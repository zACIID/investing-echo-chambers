They are not taking any more reservations and now they are saying they will not be able to deliver nearly 200k reserved.

What it means is that they are having massive production problems (hell Tesla went through) and now the moment of reckoning nears.

Deliveries will be delayed.  Reservations and some models will be cancelled

sirkevly,"I don't see anything in there about them missing their production targets. This is pretty standard for a popular new vehicle launch. Even Ford can't just snap their fingers and materialize 200,000 trucks out of nothingness. Every one of these trucks that Ford makes in the next few years has basically already been sold which is great for Ford. 

Also, Tesla is not a good benchmark to compare real car manufacturers to. On one hand you have a multinational conglomerate with well established supply chains and the other is some South African dipshit's vanity project.",shtiper

Rancho8Deluxe,"You mean its not a good idea to follow financial youtube pump and dumpers advice? Lol

Now as for nio. I dont hold shares in the company anymore but i am bullish long term. I decided to take my funds and place elsewhere at the beginning of the year because i didnt see them moving too much this year. Never thought theyd dip down this hard. So im currently looking for a re entry around March 2022 as long as it stays sub 30 and hopefully china starts looking a little more safe for investors. We will see. Long term i think NIO has a bright future. Short term i wouldnt touch the options chain at all. The stock is just weirdly volatile in all the wrong ways. They release great PR it goes down. They do nothing it jumps up . The price action is just problematic from a options perspective. Unless you‚Äôre buying some 2 year leaps which at that point idk just buy shares lol


Edit: And FYI i was one of the original NIO bulls buying that stock in the $2-$4 range. All i can say is it was a wild ride and ive been chasing that dragon ever since",Illustrious_Title862

Diamondhandsforever,"Blackberry Beat Earnings and earnings analysis(The Good the bad and the misunderstood) - After taking a strong run yesterday up 4% Blackberry is trading 3% down after earnings.

**The Good: Complete earnings beat**  


* **Non-GAAP EPS**: US$0.00 (beat by US$0.07) last quarter they beat earnings by a mere. 01 and the stock surged.
* **GAAP EPS**: - US$0.05 (beat by US$0.11)
* **Revenue:** US$184m (beat by US$7.42)

**The Bad: Revenue Growth -17% Y/Y** 

Topline this number looks bad, many big tech names have Y/Y sales trending downwards, but for a growth company, this is simply a miss.  **The stock initially popped after hours on earnings beat, but then dropped on this information alone.** 

**The misunderstood:** 

Blackberry is at a transition point as a company moving away from its business of old to becoming more of a cybersecurity firm and automative software play. Guidance showed that cybersecurity is going to be its largest revenue source moving forward, but what's not discussed enough is its penetration into the automotive industry  


In the past month, BMW and M&M both announced agreements to use Blackberry's QNX technology in their vehicles.  They are now involved with 45 automotive companies and over 195 vehicles worldwide. **195 million vehicles worldwide?!?!** They are cornering the market and nobody seems to love the potential here! VW and Toyota both sell about 10 million cars a year, and yet that's nothing compared to their market penetrations

Furthermore, they have 707 million on cash on hand, and for a company valued at less than 5 bullion that is unheard of. They have the cash to execute their vision and the numbers to dominate the cybersecurity vehicle market.

This isn't a BB to the Moon DD, god knows we don't need another one of those. This is trying to get a grasp of earnings and an understanding of where the companies future lies  


I am not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice.

You risked too much, and that‚Äôs the part to learn from.  Don‚Äôt do that again. But other than that you may not have done anything dumb. You never know what‚Äôs going to happen in the market. You could have made logical decisions and they just didn‚Äôt work out for whatever reason. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up too bad over your investment choices as none of us have a crystal ball.

Lastly, that money is gone. Aside from learning not to take on that much risk again, do everything you can to just forget about it. Easier said than done‚Ä¶ but nothing good will come of beating yourself up about it.",undisreetanonymity

1. Good on you for giving it a try. Millions never do. We joke about the outcome bring ‚Äúhomeless or lambo‚Äù. That means taking a risk. You did, you lost, but it could have ended differently.

2. Learn from this. Preserve your capital next time. Sell when you‚Äôre 10% down and live to fight another day. 

3. Once you‚Äôre back in a position to invest, take the safe option, at least for starters. Once you have some gains, you can start to roll the dice a bit more again.

And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority.

And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after the beast.

And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?

I mean I would like to comment on something negative, but this sub is so biased everything you type (-) will instantly get downvoted and vanilla-countered, lol.  
  
For a company that has been hyped so much year-two years ago to see a declining revenue and 180 mil. for what - 6 mlrd. cap? Is quite weak and the transition that Chen is doing is taking what, 10 years already or so?  
  
Don't get me wrong, I am holding 3000 shares stuck at 12 bucks and I am in for a long term, but please quit with this biased documentation of how 'good' this is, because it ain't.  
  
The transition is quite slow and we are waiting for that patent sale already for more than a year. Remember how many posts and ideas were there literally spamming/claiming 'it's always the next month' basically?  
  
It's quite explainable why BB is stuck at the same price and why floor seems to be at 8 dollars or so. I doubt we will reach 30 bucks in the next few years, and I am being generous. We are worshiping a company that has reported lower and lower earnings for like several years in a row.  
  
Stay here if you believe in their process for 5-7 years at least, because if you are here for 1-2 years, hell even possibly 3, I believe there are way better investments.

995511abc,"Hi all, Here are the best bullish charts I‚Äôve found this month. I have a position in all full disclosure after buying my last positions yesterday and today. Good luck hope this peaks your interest! Merry Christmas

TFX - Teleflex: Medical device company focused on urinary issues as well as fluid draining of lungs. They‚Äôre products are always in high demand for catheters etc. but Covid has really boosted lung product sales.

CTT - Catchmark Timber Trust: Owns and harvests on high quality timberlands that have been producing at high levels recently due to timber boom and housing boom.

ENR - Energizer Holdings: batteries. I like the chart and we‚Äôre heading into Christmas which is like battery pallooza for the industry.

FSS - Federal Signal Corporation: makes radios, sirens, speciality electronics for huge gvt police, fire military etc contracts. Great chart

MSGS - Madison Square Garden: great dip this month due to fears of closing nba and nhl seasons due to Covid. Msgs owns the knicks and the rangers and the garden itself. Rangers just set a record nhl valuation at $2 billion. That‚Äôs huge for an nhl team. Should move msgs significantly higher.

MBT - Mobile Telesystems: literally just riding the ups and waiting for super predictable dips on this one for the last 7 months. easy money honestly

NYT - New York Times: self explanatory. Great bullish set up right now.

STE - Steris: medical equipment company specializing in sterilization products for hospitals which has been awesome throughout Covid. Great chart and nice hedge for an unforeseen omicron wave.",AutoModerator

spinnerette_,"That's why the ~~fire hazard~~ building comes with housing space for 4,500+ people.",Hott_Cheese
spinnerette_,"I see so many potential problems with it. Maybe it's because I lost everything to an apartment fire that ended up collapsing due to the weight of the water, and that is really affecting how I am looking at this building. I cannot imagine if a serious accident were to happen in a building like this, where there are so few windows, could be a safe place to live. The bedrooms are tiny, the only space students would have to study and relax is a tiny desk. I'd be so depressed living there.

I understand that there is a serious housing shortage and people need to go to school. If something like this allows for students to actually survive college without eating a pack of ramen a day while UCSB plows them into debt, that's good I guess. I'm in a spot where I understand there is a problem very closely linked to low paid jobs for college students, ridiculous housing costs, lack of housing lose to campus, etc. Just really have an issue with the fact that UCSB has known about this problem for a very long time and continues to  admit more students than the area can actually reasonably care for. The design feels extremely exploitative and out of touch with the needs of students, especially with the lack of natural light (many students won't have a window at all) and space to be alone.  I'm sure UCSB has study spaces on campus, but really having your own space to relax is a must. Having so many roommates would've driven me up the wall. Plus having that many people living in such close quarters is just asking for a major covid outbreak if this thing actually goes up. The dude is *not* an architect.

[This chick](https://youtu.be/_zGlBd4HG2I) explains some of the reasons why I'm so hesitant about it. It just feels like an inhumane bandage to a complex problem. I cannot imagine 4500+ college students being crammed into those places. 8 people to a dorm is a lot as is. Hell, having 4 people in my dorm was difficult. My friends had it much worse with 6, shared rooms. I consider myself extremely fucking lucky that I was in a position where my university refused multi-occupant dorm rooms. We didn't have a lot of space, but we made it work. Not saying other dorms are any better at many colleges at all. 

We really need to start prioritizing the health and safety of students without price gouging them or shoving them into dorms like a bunch of rats. Just a shit situation that cannot be fixed easily. I feel like Munger's design would end up spreading. It is ""good enough"" but the priorities aren't in the right place (shocker). I do think something *like* this could work if the size shrunk, multiple buildings were made instead of one, and more attention was put into student needs. It isn't an easy problem to fix, not trying to be a realist, but you can't look at those rooms and think there's nothing that should be changed. Munger doesn't want changes. It is take the donation and the plans or leave it which is really fucked up. He does not care about fixing the student housing problem. He doesn't care about UCSB, the students, charity. He just wants to swing his lil chub around and put his name on a big building. I just really hope if this goes through, that the pricing will be *cheap*.

Edit: here's the [floorplan](https://www.noozhawk.com/images/made/images/uploads/113021-Munger-Hall-Design-UCSB-house-plan-rendering-jpg_1320_622_80_c1.jpg) for anyone wanting to see it. The video I linked above goes deeper into the plans.",SmokeySFW

Yeah but at least it was fun. Reading the autistic stuff u/Variation-Separate used to write was fun. Seeing people throw their life safings into 4/17 SPY $180p was fun. And the bear trend lasted only a few months and was entirely justified by the fact that we were in the middle of an unprecedented market volatilty event of massive proportion. People in the sub knew that they were stupid, at least.

>There's occasional DD thats worth the time (like the guy that posted thePTON put YOLO) but it does take time to filter through, there's alsoenough loss porn and ridiculously lucky gain porn to be entertaining.

How is present-day loss porn entertaining? It's only entertaining if you have lost the money in an original stupid new way. And I don't see that very often any more. Idk man maybe I've just grown up too much for this and that's why I'm grumpy",Flrg808

You have to look into it more. Yes a lot of people are just posting pictures of their red account with no information which is dumb. Just yesterday I commented on a post where an idiot bought ITM calls in a fucking video game stock at the absolute top. It turned bearish literally the next day and has fallen every day since while he holds the bags. Hilarious.
Thats what this place is about in my opinion, making fun of 22 year old retards that watched Wolf Of Wall Street too many times and have no clue what they are doing. Yes iR0nyman and the likes are few and far between but always have been. I think you are just looking back through rose colored glasses",bragghy

I hope u like when i release it - if theres a legenday autist i might have missed by all means let me know,prototype31695

AdministrativeEnd959,"Comparing ARK ETFs in 2020 to 2021 - https://www.theancienteconomist.com/post/the-ark-invest-etfs-comparing-2020-to-2021

In 2021, The Ark Innovation ETF is -21.11% YTD, The ARK Genomic Revolution ETF is down 32% YTD, and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF is down 21% YTD. The one ARK ETF in the green is their Autonomous Tech& Robotics ETF, which is up about 8% YTD.


The ARK Innovation ETF ($ARKK) is the best play with regards to getting your best bet on a solid return. The top stocks encompassing the ETF are Tesla, Roku, Teladoc, Square, Zoom, Shopify, Coinbase, and Twilio, amassing nearly 50% of its value. 



What do you guys think? Which ARK ETF is in the best position for 2022? Surely ARK will not endure the same level of horrid returns next year as 2021.",AdministrativeEnd959

bapcha,"Yet, she trades every day? I'm calling BS on that",Puzzleheaded_Stop376
Flrg808,"The problem is if you take away last year most of us wouldnt even know what ARK was. Last year was absolutely insane for tech stocks (dotcom levels) so of course ETFs invested primarily in those assets are going to explode.

You say ""beaten down"" but relative to what.. a few months ago? If it was January 2020 you would think someone is crazy if they said they would be willing to purchase ARKK at $100.",Puzzleheaded_Stop376
MeanieManh0le,I was just about to comment on $ROKU strength here. Definitely a lot of upside. The volatility on the options chain and this bullish basing pattern breaking selling pressure and reversing momentum make this a no brainer along some of the other $ARKK names.,Needleburst3

Ill-Understanding280,This is WSB.   People go rich or broke.  No cutting losses allowed.,neothedreamer
bapcha,"Obviously, I do not buy the ""rebalancing"" bullshit by Auntie Cathie. She trades in and out of the same stocks, creating taxable events

She's a schizophrenic trader. Yes, she picked some good names. Her run is done (my opinion)",DrBIackout
Puzzleheaded_Stop376,Please look at some charts past a year and you‚Äôll see how well her funds are doing. All her picks are looking past 5 years.,bapcha
waitwhat1200,That‚Äôs not a taxable event for an etf.,bapcha
methpartysupplies,"Yeah the rEbAlAnCiNg take is bs.  When she trims the Tesla position, that‚Äôs rebalancing.  But she also buys shit and sells it less than 12 months later.  That makes me doubt their whole deep research shtick and suspect ARK is just a fun club where high functioning retards yolo other people‚Äôs money.",bapcha
DrBIackout,"Exactly. The goal isn't to mimic the same returns they saw from a previous year (or two). Its about the long term. If you have to lose 20% in a year to ensure you are getting a better value in the long term, thats the cost of doing business. 

Look at someone like buffet. If he decided to ditch his big investments at 20% loss (or sometimes a lot more) he wouldn't have made the gains he has. Buying the dip is a very real strategy for any investor",Puzzleheaded_Stop376
Ill-Understanding280,"If you look at the chart before 2020,  it‚Äôs not that impressive.",Puzzleheaded_Stop376
Puzzleheaded_Stop376,Impressive for a ETF. ARKK beginning of 2017 was $21 then in the beginning of 2019 it was $42. That‚Äôs insane growth especially for an ETF. Doubling your return in two years is way above the norm on investing. The S&P had one the best years on awhile and only saw a 25% return. Anything over 10% a year is a great return.,Ill-Understanding280
Ill-Understanding280,Why ignore the years that were flat before 2017?,Puzzleheaded_Stop376
Puzzleheaded_Stop376,The entire market was relatively flat from 2014- 2016. ARKK started in 2014. But yes from the start of the fund in 2014 till 2017 it didn‚Äôt see much growth.,Ill-Understanding280

For all of us.

After a few days the pain will subside with time. And then looking back it'll only feel like the loss of a relative or family pet. Just don't think about all the vacations and things and experiences that money couldve gone to.

Think about all the years of $3k tax write offs you'll get.
More importantly, know that you will come back stronger, and this loss will eventually be all a write off against your larger, future gains.

Just don't quit options. Cuz then you'll be a quiter. And you miss 100% of the shots you never take - Michael Scott.

And you're going to be ashamed so it's unlikely you will end up telling many people you know irl about it.

But if you let it weigh on you it will drag you the fuck down, and you will feel helpless and isolated like there's no way back.

But you have to fight hard against all of that. Money really is just money. Look how much central bankers give to themselves and all their best friends. It's all a fucking joke. Fiat is whatever. Not a good life to aspire to accumulate a lot. But of course we can do other things with money. Maybe people, together, can build some kind of non-shitty future. Try to be a part of that.

At the end of your 30 year period, you will have $127k. Your yearly contribution at that point is only $2200, so again this is very realistic. If you stop reinvesting your returns at that point you are getting on average $7.6k/year just by holding the stock and earning a dividend.",AwesomeJohn01

It's best to just post up at a nice hotel bar and you'll get approached within an hour. These are usually the sole proprietor hoes with no middle man taking a chunk of the cash. Gotta learn the lingo though, everything is said between the lines. Talk for awhile and casually take note of the people around you and see if anything looks off or you catch a couple guys looking over a little too often etc.

 In your room you do the finger test, no cop is going to allow that, and you never allow money to exchange hands. Pull money out of your wallet and count it in front of her and set your wallet back down with the money on top. If she has a big bag you gotta search that shit for a weapon.

TrackingPundits,"Tracking CNBC Option Action Recommendation 2021 Profitability Results - Have you ever wondered how good the CNBC celebrity investment pundits perform on option trades? Are the experts better than just investing in a market index fund?

Over the last year, I've monitored every one of the CNBC Option Action recommended trades and discovered that on an overall basis, Melissa Lee, Mike Khouw, Carter Braxton Worth, and Tony Zhang did pretty well.

* Total 2021 Options Action trades - 117 of which 39% were profitable (excludes high risk trades)
* Total profit for the year 13% (but holding period is only 64 calendar days), so you can multiply profits throughout the year
* My Favorite trade of the year - June 4, 2021 Option Action show:
   * Sell AMC $65 straddle for $69 when stock price closed at $47.91 yielding a 633% profit in two weeks. This was during the meme stock mania.
* Best recent trade on CNBC Options Action trade
   * The October 15, 2021 show recommended to Buy a Call Butterfly expiring November 19th at $650/$680/$710 strikes
   * The net cost of the option was only $4.30 or for a single contract $430.
   * The stock closed at $678.80 on November 19, 2021 yielding a profit of 572%
* Best month of the year was November 2021 where there were 10 trades expiring, seven of which were profitable yielding a monthly gain of 127%.
* Worst month of the year was August 2021 where there were 9 trades expiring, eight of which lost money with a monthly loss of 41%.
* If one started in January, trading every one of the option recommendations, there was never a time where your original capital went negative. This is partially due to a great start in January 2021 with a 112% gain.

At least for 2021, the CNBC Option Action pundits did a pretty good job. Hopefully, this trend will continue into the future.",TrackingPundits

Miladyboi,"Opportunity: Low Retail Volume + High Short Interest - This setup with stocks that have low retail volume/interest + high short interest has the potential to be explosive. Let me explain.

I was watching a meet Kevin video (I know I'm a dumbass) and he brought up some data that he found with one of his expensive resources that is commonly used with big banks and hedge funds. Essentially, these institutions, since the gamester fiasco, pay extreme attention towards retail volume on stocks they're shorting. The examples that Kevin brought up were Corsair, Shift, and Lemonade. With these names, it appears that when retail begins buying the dips and pouring in, hedge funds quickly close their short positions in an attempt to minimize their losses or take profits, then, when retail interest dies down, they pile on with their shorts again.

I found this very intriguing as I believe it presents an extremely large opportunity. First, just the sight of a few retail investors pouring into stocks like this will cause these institutions to RAPIDLY close their short positions, the actual price movement may not even be that significant but when they observe data displaying a surge in retail volume, they will flee for the hills. Additionally, institutions at this time of year are looking to close short positions on stocks like CRSR, Shift, and LMND because they're already up a significant amount, the year is coming to an end, and they may be anticipating a Santa clause rally .

All of these factors lead me to believe that names with low retail volume and high short interest are extremely large opportunities at this moment. I personally like CRSR as it seems they have the best fundamentals compared to other names that fit this criteria but there may also be other opportunities out there.

What do ya'll think?

Is this strategy viable?

What are some other names that fall under this criteria?

**Additionally, I do not endorse any of these names, mods please do not take down my post, I put in genuine effort and I'm not trying to pump anything, just spreading a kinda cool strategy**",Miladyboi

I had plenty of time to get out with some profit, and despite recognizing what was going on, I still held because I'm an idiot. The funny thing is that it was one of those ""rainbow"" days, and if I'd held longer, I could have sold for minor profit by the end of the same day, but I was afraid it would keep going up and I didn't want to take that big of a hit. Obviously I still need to practice and not be an idiot, but optionstrat helped me a lot, and if I'd adhered to what I had learned from it, I wouldn't have taken that L.

AxemanFromMA,"SPY to the Moon - **Prediction Feb 18th:** $535-540 \*not financial advice\*

**Postions: Attached**

&#x200B;

Looking at the chart you will notice SPY has been trading flat for around 50 days. SPY has never done this before (rare). Very heavy price consolidation = breakout soon

During an uptrend, the RSI tends to stay above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a downtrend, it is rare to see the RSI exceed 70, and the indicator frequently hits 30 or under.

&#x200B;

The recent sell-off/loss momentum in trend in my opinion was because of Evergrande/Debt Ceiling/No Stimmy, just overall a dried-up economy. Every earnings shit the bed, I hated my life being a perma-bull. Then I noticed how in the world is SPY trading flat for legit 2 months? SPY has never done this before. So I did some research and noticed the following. This new covid variant is a literal covid bull run again. Our gov won't let the economy crash when the ICU at hospitals are filling up faster than they have ever before.

&#x200B;

**No taper + Rate hikes + Stimmy (Look at EU data excluding England, they are retarded)**

&#x200B;

There is a literal ladder attack on SPY. Mofos keeping it under ATH so they profit shorting. Looking at the data you will notice this major bull flag with Biden's Build Back Better bill about to pass.

&#x200B;

**Failed to Deliver**

Date: 11/30

SPY Price: $464.60

The number of shares: 4,735,862

Value of shares in USD: $2,200,281,485.20

[https://ibb.co/xFwpRCc](https://ibb.co/xFwpRCc)

&#x200B;

You read that correct, legit $2.2 BILLION in shares have been failed to deliver. So it is under my assumption when Dems use reconciliation (pass BBB) without intervention this short will want to buy shares NOT at a higher price compared to what they shorted (since the low probability of SPY being stuck between $450-$473 again).

&#x200B;

This means SPY will likely gamma once it's greater than $464.60. Look at the IV of 12/31 deep OTM calls and you will understand why they aren't worthless. In order for this to happen people must buy shares and hold (likely based on SPY price consolidation).

&#x200B;

**Probability**

Very high in my opinion. 10 million in buy orders on no news yesterday, 2 million buy orders today at the close of the trading day, and an options trader bet $65 million on deep OTM calls exp before x mas. Who would do this without knowing anything? Probably Pelosi IMO.

Miladyboi,what the fuck are face expressions,JordanAli8112
Miladyboi,this was recently exposed and reveals how with minimal volume can cause an extremely large upwards movement.,Madmaxoncrack

Shortdast0ck,"I once met up with a friend whose dad was a union rep.  Let me tell you his house was hooked up.  This was the early 2000s I believe and all I remember was that he had this giant remote control thing that controlled everything in his homes from the blinds to the gigantic tv to the lighting in his room.  After we left I asked the friend what their dad did and that‚Äôs when I found out being a union rep pays.

Second person I met that actually worked for a union was a neighborhood childhood friends mom.  Worked in a union her entire life as a secretary to the boss and she just said flat out that they are corrupt as shit.  It‚Äôs a family racket where they hire relatives and just give these positions big salaries and they don‚Äôt do shit for it.  I had really no opinion either way and she was retired but she was happy to retire and not deal with the nepotism apparently.

But as an adult, I now realize why the Mob is so big on unions.",Stable-Weak

XchrisZ,"They didn't even give the new workers a chance. I've worked factory jobs it takes like 2 months to be decent. 

Knowing factory workers they probably sabotaged the machinery just enough on the way out to make it not work perfect.

Affectionate_Law3788,"In the sense that politicians promise you a workers utopia if you give them money, and then barely anything changes but now you're forced to continue giving them money whether you like it or not; and that they sound great on paper but tend to not be so great in reality.

They're basically an HOA but for your job. It has it pros and cons though: on the one hand you have to pay dues regardless of how you feel about the union... on the other hand it can make it a bitch to fire you unless you break clearly defined rules repeatedly and it's documented. Honestly depends on the industry and how good the union is.",aj0hn5

Totally possible. I used to work in a factory where employees hated management. Im sure if they were on their way out and getting replaced due to grievances not being met this scenario of sabotage would totally be possible",XchrisZ

Shortdast0ck,"Incorrect.  I‚Äôve worked and have been part of a union.  It was a grocery store.  I had zero option to opt out.  I had to pay my dues and it was automatically deducted from my check.  I could opt out of being represented but they still got to keep my dues.  I worked less than 20 hours a week.  It was a bullshit job working at the Pharmacy during my retail college years.  Seniority is based on the number of years you worked there.  So I actually ended up making less money because of the union.  

Imagine that.  Oh and the grocery store was Safeway.",Smash_4dams

XchrisZ,Factory work isn't as bad as retail or customer service but it is alot harder than most people think. Good thing those workers have a union because apes strong together.,slashrshot

Emotional-Proof-6154,"That was a crapy and weak union.

And unions are not meant to help part time workers in college either.. they are for full time career people.

I am part of the IBEW now and its an amazing union.

In highschool i worked fred meyer and had to pay dues to that same weak shity union you mentioned without any benefits since i was part time. Some unions are silly, but many are very good.",Shortdast0ck

XchrisZ,Or the comradery of I'll throw this to you and you stack it on that skid while we wait for the fork lift. Dean's on tonight and you know he's slow as fuck and we won't make incentive if we don't.,Rancho8Deluxe
XchrisZ,"In a good union place yes. But in general better than retail, fast food and things like that but not much better. It's not a high skill job so lots of people are qualified so that makes it hard to find a good one. Also if you're good paying factory closes up shop and moves you're fucked (you have learned very few skills and the ones you have learned are pretty much eaaily picked up or a specific to the place that just closed) especially if you're over 45. So if you have the opportunity get a skill trade or go to post secondary education in a field that is in demand. 

I would only recommend factory work to dumb people (they're qualified) or someone that's stuck in a situation like 2 kids no high school diploma and 19. Even then apprenticeships usually pay well enough I'd say stick it out in there well you get your GED and apply at every skill trade place around (plumber, electrician, carpenter, HVAC and things like that). Being a skill trade in a factory isn't bad though if the factory you're in closes up shop your skills are indemand and lots of other places will hire you.",AssistThick3636

The company isn't paying these Union terms, it is the customer who buys the product foots the bill.",slashrshot

slashrshot,"we dont live in a world of technicalities, output IS affected.

workers back to work so factories keep producing. - bullish    
costs passed to consumers not impacting margin - bullish  
before you go on about people not buying their products, this has been ongoing for weeks and they are still selling so its unlikely to be a factor going forward.",Im_A_MechanicalMan
Im_A_MechanicalMan,"Output was apparently not affected to the point of shortage during the entirety of the strike.

But now the output costs more to produce.  Which was my point.  Kelloggs isn't just going to reduce compensation for executives to make up the difference in higher costs for line workers, instead they'll shrink product size and/or increase product cost to the consumer.",slashrshot

moneygrabber007,"I agree but it‚Äôs always easy to run into what seem like inconsistencies in the market when you compare two stocks.

There are too many factors in play. But in general the reason why the street treats Crowdstrike more favorably is bc:

It was founded 10 years ago, has been publicly traded for 2.5 years, it is based in the US, and it has a recent track record of positive and growing EPS.

BB is based in Canada, EPS have been all over the place, are trying to reinvent themselves as a software/cybersecurity company after being founded 37 years ago and publicly traded for 22 years.

The street favors new, exciting, US based, profitable companies due to less risk. Crowdstrike is that and BB is not right now.",Greyside4k

DownrightNeighborly,You‚Äôre giving me second thoughts about my 2000 shares of PLTR,No-Move-9576
No-Move-9576,"Well, thats stock only works on marketing, they spent 150Musd in maketing this year. That company never made any profit the past 10 years, i dont see any reason for this to change. Some of the contracts they recently secured was thru spac and nobody knows how they will get paid for those. To me it is a scam, but poeple are so naive sometimes that they could keep on buying, you never know....Poeple probably thought it would fly like snowflakes but it did not until now.",DownrightNeighborly

Ok_Commission_3368,"Markets at close: 12/21/2021 - **Today in brief**

**S&P: 4,649.23 (+81.21) (+1.78%)**

**Dow: 35,492.70 (+560.54) (+1.60%)**

**Nasdaq: 15,341.09 (+360.14) (+2.40%)**

Following the rout yesterday, Global stock markets were on the upswing today and the same was reflected in the US markets. The indices recouped the Monday losses and closed above Friday‚Äôs (12/17) close though nothing much has changed in terms of the concerns on the Omicron variant, which is fast becoming the dominant variant throughout the US and the World. Even with the cases rising and restrictions increasing, the general public is in a much better position to handle this new variant; vaccinations and general awareness on masks and social distancing is sure to help this leg of the pandemic to be in the rear-view mirror with much less damage.

Shares of Micron Technology was up by more than 10% following its beat of topline and EPS in its Q1 earnings and the subsequent strong chip demand forecast. The company‚Äôs shares have been trading sideways this year but has been attracting lots of attention on its DRAM and NAND Flash storage.

EV Company and pandemic-era favorite Nikola will pay a fine of $125 Mn in settlement with SEC over alleged false claims by Nikola‚Äôs ex-CEO Trevor Milton. Nikola neither accepted nor denied the claims of Milton in terms of the settlement. Nikola currently trades above $9 which is a fraction of $70+ it traded in mid-2020s. Hindenburg‚Äôs damaging report and the subsequent watered-down deal with GM reversed the tides for this stock.

Another meme stock, WISH, jumped up by more than 14% today. For the year though the ecommerce stock is down by more than 80%.

Airlines and Cruise stocks were all up today with DAL (+5.9%), AAL (+4.7%), UAL (+6.9%), CCL (+8.7%) and RCL (+5.4%) significantly in the green following a positive report by Bank of America. According to the report, domestic bookings have been largely resilient in the face of Omicron thus far with more softness in the international bookings. Cruise stocks continued the momentum on the favorable commentary by the management of CCL yesterday.",Ok_Commission_3368

The other 50k of gains would be subjected to early withdraw penalties if you were to take those out.

About as much as I do now, which is ‚Äúalmost never except for when I want to get rid of physical items I don‚Äôt care about because they‚Äôre taking up more space than they‚Äôre worth.‚Äù Console platforms have had the resources to implement this for a long time, they reason they haven‚Äôt done it is because there is literally no money in this. Furthermore they can all simply refuse to generate or sell digital keys of their game on any other platform, like publishers are doing on Steam/Epic and like Sony is doing with PlayStation games.

She's on top of you, voraciously pumping up and down over and over again on your rock hard 4.5 inches of man meat. You're both covered in sweat. Her breasts are smothering your face and you are lapping up every droplet of sweat from the tips her nipples. One of your hands is fingerings her ass and the other is tightly gripping her hip. Her hands are gripping the back of your shoulders with nails piecing the skin and your back hair intertwined with her fingers. You feel like you're going to cum and are fighting it because you want to enjoy every moment. She keeps saying ""you're so hard, you make me so wet, you're such a man"". You can feel a mixture of sweat and feminine fluids running through your pubes and dripping down the inside of your thighs. Eventually, you can't take it anymore, you cum. Luckily, at the same time, she screams in ecstacy, leaving claw marks on your back and ripping out large handfuls of hair. She screams ""you're such a sexy buuuuuullllllllll!!!!!""

After finishing the orgasm, She roles off of you and rests silently for a few moments before asking ""can I see your Robinhood account? I couldn't help but overhear you talking with your friends about all the calls you bought during the dip"". You get nervous but open up Robinhood on your phone and show her the account (account is filled with puts). Her expression instantly turns to agitation. She says ""what the fuck? You said you were a permabull???"" You freeze up and try to speak but all that comes out is rambling about recessions, inflation, rising interest rates, etc. She throws the phone at your face, which gives you a black eye, and screams ""get fuck out of my house you ghey bear!!!"" You jump up, quickly dress, and exit the home. 

Sitting in your car, you lament your loss. After many years of mostly being celibate, you thought you had found the one. Driving home, you keep thinking over and over, ""why am I such a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà üêª?...""",AutoModerator

fufm,"I figured out why musk did the twitter poll and that he was honest when he said he would abide by the results, no matter what the result was.

He was gonna dump a massive amount of shares either way and rather than shock the world when the news of him actually selling broke, he decided to do it himself in meme fashion. That way when he actually started selling it wouldn‚Äôt really be big news and truly crash Tesla before he had enough time to get out.

The funny part is both answers were true. If it had been ‚Äúno‚Äù him selling something like 50% would still be ‚Äúabiding by the results‚Äù and the way he structured his sells incrementally would make it look like he was selling <10% at first. By the time people realized he was selling more, it would have given him enough time to sell a huge amount without Tesla crashing.

With ‚Äúyes‚Äù it‚Äôs the same thing - small incremental sells would be very minor news in comparison with the tweet news and once he passes 10% it‚Äôs still ‚Äúabiding by the results‚Äù because he **did** sell 10%, he just didn‚Äôt stop there.

995511abc,"Hi all, Here are the best bullish charts I‚Äôve found this month. I have a position in all full disclosure after buying my last positions yesterday and today. Good luck hope this peaks your interest! Merry Christmas

TFX - Teleflex: Medical device company focused on urinary issues as well as fluid draining of lungs. They‚Äôre products are always in high demand for catheters etc. but Covid has really boosted lung product sales.

CTT - Catchmark Timber Trust: Owns and harvests on high quality timberlands that have been producing at high levels recently due to timber boom and housing boom.

ENR - Energizer Holdings: batteries. I like the chart and we‚Äôre heading into Christmas which is like battery pallooza for the industry.

FSS - Federal Signal Corporation: makes radios, sirens, speciality electronics for huge gvt police, fire military etc contracts. Great chart

MSGS - Madison Square Garden: great dip this month due to fears of closing nba and nhl seasons due to Covid. Msgs owns the knicks and the rangers and the garden itself. Rangers just set a record nhl valuation at $2 billion. That‚Äôs huge for an nhl team. Should move msgs significantly higher.

MBT - Mobile Telesystems: literally just riding the ups and waiting for super predictable dips on this one for the last 7 months. easy money honestly

NYT - New York Times: self explanatory. Great bullish set up right now.

STE - Steris: medical equipment company specializing in sterilization products for hospitals which has been awesome throughout Covid. Great chart and nice hedge for an unforeseen omicron wave.",AutoModerator

off_by_two,"I think puts are a better short term play for a ticker like MRNA.  It only has one product and a small float, which both contribute to it having some wild price volatility as we've seen.  I think it'll dip under 200 before it tops 350 again, but it could do both in the next month or two depending on how covid goes.  

Long term, I'd be more comfortable betting on them getting FDA approval on more and more applications of their base tech.  MRNA is still going to be a low float biotech company and very prone to pumping on a single news story.  Additionally last I checked they have around $9B cash and \~3B quarterly revenue, which makes me think that at least while most of the world is desperate for Covid vaccines, they are not going to need to offer more shares to raise capital for expansion soon.

I'd say wait for a good entry, say after a long slow bleed because Omicron is being handled and go in for 2024 leap calls if you are going to be placing LEAPs on MRNA, but thats just me.",Ramboow23

chronictherapist,"So they're like most every other company releasing a highly complicated product for the first time?

Good to know.

That ultra rich dude who buys this car is probably SUPER picky about damn near everything he buys?

Good to know.

The fact that the review itself, written by an owner, specifically states ""This will likely get better with software updates"" multiple times about most of the ""negative"" stuff he discussed?

Also good to know.

The fact that replies to the original review often points to the fact that the owner apparently didn't RTFM on his 175k car? I get that 175k should be intuitive, but cars are intuitive because there are decades of use and habits to look at of god only knows how many drivers.

Hintenhobin,"I know nothing, but, it's early in Lucids life to make long term assumptions about product quality. In the review itself the customer states that the hardware aspect of the vehicle meet his high expectations. So the chassis, the drivetrain, the suspension, they got that right, which is important. 

Not to say software is not as equally important. However it's a lot easier to patch crappy software than it is to patch a poorly engineered platform. 

If there are widespread issues arising from the software then a dip may follow, but as far as being a product ending issue, this isn't it. 

That being said if Lucid does nothing over the next 6 months to a year to resolve these issue THEN would be the time to start growing concerned. But as it stands this just appears to be growing pains.

devnah721,"China Omicron Bear Thesis... - China's method of dealing with COVID is zero tolerance.  It will lockdown an entire city over a few cases. As a result very few Chinese have had any covid -- they're all covid virgins.  Their vaccine provides almost no protection against Omicron infection, and is far less effective against COVID generally as our MRNA vaccines.  The reason for their strict controls is that their own analysis is that their hospitals would be overrun if Covid got out of control.

Now the omicron variant is up to 70x more contagious.  Cramer got it, and then gave it to his co-host while testing negative.  The tests don't pick it up fast enough to stop the spread.  The US headlines say it went from 3% of cases to 73% in this country in just a week.  Hard to believe, but if that's remotely true how can it be stopped?  I doubt no matter how strict China is that they will be able to contain Omicron, and even if they do it will only be due to resorting to extreme lockdowns.

It doesn't matter that Omicron is less fatal, China only known response is zero tolerance lockdowns.  Omicron is like the gate-crasher variant, it may overrun the system with positives, hospitalizations, making it harder to prevent the spread of other variants which China has kept out thus far and which they have no immunity and only a partially effective vaccine against normal COVID.

sportspadawan13,"As someone who was there for initial breakout (my city was immediately after Wuhan), it'll be controlled. We're talking welding or magnetically sealing people inside their apartments if they've even come in contact with anyone who has come in contact with anyone who has gotten COVID. They do multiple layers of contact tracing. Every place makes you scan in (well...some people get lazy when they know you being there every day), and they force tests of entire cities if there is a breakout anywhere, regardless of geography (also went through this). When I was there, they even raised quarantine to 3 weeks for a few months. I left because I tend to like my family and want to see them and it was exhausting. Just not worth it, plus the propaganda was turned up to 11. Anyway. I just don't see it spreading. They already controlled Omicron in Hangzhou (friend there) and Ningbo (other friend). I should also state that if you are from a city with an outbreak, there is a good chance you will be banned from airplanes or even airports depending. I went on a vacation and was banned from going indoors anywhere despite the breakout in my city occurring when I wasn't even there.

Dumb_Vampire_Girl,"The only good thing about Omicron is that the rapid infections means we are getting closer to herd immunity.

Maybe it's almost a blessing in disguise.

Honestly, considering the world population proved that a large enough of them refuse to take the vaccine, maybe next time it would be better if governments just let us get ravaged by the next pandemic unless that virus has an insane kill rate. It seems like herd immunity through natural means and not a vaccine might have been the ""best"" way to deal with this pandemic. 

Although, if the government decided that, I wonder if the population would then start begging for vaccines/help instead of being abandoned by the government. Human behavior is weird. We are constantly wishing for the other option. 

In terms of economics, lockdowns have fucked us mostly because we did not vaccinate fast enough. It's a case of the cure being worse than the disease.",devnah721
not_creative1,"I have been thinking this same thing.

There is only 2 ways this can end for China:

1. They continue the zero covid policy, lockdown the country over and over again until the economy goes to shit. This is especially hard considering they have the winder Olympics next year and a ton of foreigners are coming.


2. Covid (likely omicron) runs through the country like never seen before as vaccines aren‚Äôt really stopping the spread, and Chinese vaccine is shown to have almost no effect on omicron. This means, chinas time to dance with covid is coming. They will have far fewer deaths, but considering how contagious omicron is, it will run through China in record pace and even if 1 in 2000 people die, it running through even half of Chinese population in 1 month means 250,000 deaths. That will grind the country‚Äôs healthcare system to a halt. 

Everywhere else, people have been getting covid in waves which has artificially provided time. Omicron will create a wave like never before in China and even if it is less fatal, just the shear number of cases will overwhelm any healthcare system. 

Interesting couple of years ahead for China",devnah721
ScareOffEverything,"The problem is that you think that China‚Äôs lockdowns have been effective because you think they‚Äôre reporting accurate Covid case numbers.

Also, highly doubt the harsh lockdowns would have eradicated this virus. Our vaccines don't even kill the virus, just promote antibody production to defend oneself better against Covid. We already live with multiple other strains of Sars-covid viruses. Even the WHO, believe what they say or not, claim that only two viruses have been eradicated by humans and the work of vaccines. Smallpox is the only one that is found in humans. The other is a bovine virus. So, even with the medical breakthroughs of mRNA vaccines and looking back at the work of the flu vaccines, we've seen no other viruses eradicated by any means since 1980. The variola major virus still exists, humans will rarely be infected with smallpox but it doesn't mean we actually killed the virus from still existing in nature.

phanzov36,"Ok, thank you. I'm very much the opposite of a covid doomer but I bet if there's a lot of evidence that even the oversensitive PCR tests are missing contagious omicron, 2020 will look like a trial run in terms of government action. Hoping it doesn't come to that.",devnah721

phanzov36,"Is this recently though? Prior to omicron, the concern with pcr is that they catch old and broken virus and produced false positives, or at least, no longer contagious positives.",WalkMaximum
Dumb_Vampire_Girl,"Depends on the mutation. It could also mutate to be more infectious, yet less deadly, like the cold. 

I believe Omicron is actually weaker than Delta, but it spreads like crazy. Still deadly though as there have been cases of people dying from Omicron.

While I preferred that everyone got vaccinated, I've kind of given up on hoping people would. If I was in charge, I would have to either force everyone to get vaccinated, or just let the pandemic do its thing so everyone is naturally immune by the end of it. 

Considering how the population acted during covid, I'm pretty sure the latter would be what they prefer. People are stupid. Might as well give us what we deserve. At least they will be either happy or dead.",Adventurous_Ear_7788

Rather than a salary, Elon's compensation from Tesla comes in stock options so that a large portion of his net worth is in Tesla stock rather than liquid currency or other assents.  His contract with Tesla has 20-something million shares in performance incentive stock options with a strike price of $6.24 built in for compensation.  He's hitting those incentives and getting the opportunity to buy Tesla stock at $6.24/share.  If he exercises all of those options, it'll leave him with a huge capital gain for the year and a $12B tax bill.  He can fund that in one of two ways:  1) Sell enough Tesla stock to cover the bill OR 2) use some of stock as collateral.  He's taken Option 2 in the past.

Income is earned $ from working (salary, compensation packages etc) or when they sell their assets - their cost basis on those assets.

Every time I hear this it's the same projection. No, plenty of people just want to be comfortable without stepping on any toes. It's the greedy fucks who've introduced hussle culture as the norm who've turned morality into a poor man's quality. And the reality is that you wont be rich acting like them, because you're not in the in-group.

And he's made dirty millionaires. There is literally trillions of dollars locked up in a stock that is conpletely ballooned and bubbled out of proportion. Money isn't created out of thin air, and most rich assholes took the hint a long time ago to keep away from tsla or ride the bubble, not push against it.

They are masters of pulling out early, and elon will easily have access to those resources. When tsla shocks the market with its pop, it will cause exponentially more destitute individuals than it does or will 1%-ers.

He could then owe additional tax when he sells the share between the price he acquire the share for and the then current price. 

 It works the same as RSU (restricted stock units).  I used to get them when I worked at Adobe. I always received a locked in price or 15% less than market whichever was lower.

Araphoren,"VCRA - the Boomer Rip: +100% institution holds & low IV hedges - This is happening real-time (read: now) so I‚Äôm going to get right to the point.¬†

Vocera (VCRA) provides and sells wireless solutions (software and hardware) to hospitals and various industries. They‚Äôre profitable and doing great. More later.¬†

What you need to know is that shorts are closing for EOY rebalance. This is a huge problem for them as institutions hold so much of the stock that the trading float is literally virtually 0. The liquidity is so bad that even small shorts closing out are spiking all time highs. Meanwhile, calls are very cheap since nobody knows about this boomer stock. Open interest on the Jan exp is effectively 0 and implied vol is only **50%\***.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/iza3o24fgx681.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4acdffef8cda14bb9736c233d18404360b430ce1

As shares and calls are purchased, I am betting on a sustained bleed up of closing shorts, low liquidity, and OTF long term holders who aren‚Äôt selling. My aim is far beyond the 70c strike.¬†

Summary

* **Non-existent float**: The entire float is held by long-term OTF holders who aren‚Äôt selling (largest 30 firms own 92% of all shares). This is very important.
* **Short rebalance**: Short shorts are in the process of closing out by EOY rebalance and are spiking the price to ATH.
* **Historical IV has been low while the daily moves are high.** IV is 50%. Calls are cheap for where I believe the price will go. As an example, the 60c at close yesterday was $5.8 (b/e at $65.8), which we‚Äôre close to hitting already.
* **Continual upgrades:** Firms are exacerbating the process by issuing upgrades encouraging new longs to buy.

**About**

Vocera (VCRA) offers the leading platforms for workflow and communication. They create and sell both softwares and hardwares to healthcare professionals and many retail service enterprises. They are killing it.

Vocera is deployed in nearly 20% of all U.S. hospitals. Their expanded deployments, while aggressive, have only been matched by further company developments. For example, VCRA‚Äôs pivot to software-led enterprise sales was utilized in a Cleveland Clinic expansion in Q3 as one example in their second largest deal ever signed. They have been winning contract after contract flawlessly.¬†

VCRA delivered a nearly perfect Q3 with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS beating consensus estimates. FY21 was raised for the **3rd** time this year.¬†

Recent upgrades include:

Dec 20: [Hallum $71 outperform¬†](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Vocera+Communications+%28VCRA%29+PT+Raised+to+%2471+at+Craig-Hallum/19372456.html?classic=1)

Nov 29: [Sandler $68 overweight](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-vcra-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-11-2-3/)

Nov 22: [BTIG $70 buy](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3415040&headline=VCRA-Vocera-price-target-raised-to--from--at-BTIG)

So what, great company? Well firms have been loading up nonstop and now we have yet another fully share-utilized company.¬†

**Eight Years of +100% Institutional Holdings = null float**

https://preview.redd.it/0iqoq2lggx681.png?width=3167&format=png&auto=webp&s=5094a59c6c4df77b1a54559a567fdbd83a194841

Institutional holdings have shown +100% for 8 consecutive years because so many of the firms are OTF holders who won‚Äôt sell. This is very important. The 30 biggest funds hold and have been holding 31.7m shares (**that‚Äôs 92% of all outstanding shares**) for years now. They won‚Äôt be selling anytime soon. These funds hold for 5, 10, 20 years. I included the share history below. Note that there are no lock-ups expiring. There are no warrants. There is no convertible share trap waiting to explode. It is simply a small float.

https://preview.redd.it/fp6fwjoigx681.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb6f6f623552e0560ff1db2fe1833ab0739d018c

I‚Äôll say it again: the largest buyers aren‚Äôt selling and leave less than 3m (true number is closer to 0) shares for shorts to purchase to cover their shares.¬† Lower float = lower liquidity = stronger moves.¬†

**Rally into EOY**

>‚ÄúOne should note that large short positions likely need to be closed before January, which is likely to see a small-cap, value and cyclical rally‚Ä¶ We believe these conditions are not met, and hence this market episode may end up in a short and cyclical rally into year-end and January.‚Äù - [JP Morgan‚Äôs Kolanovic](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-picks-advance-while-jpmorgan-205404568.html), Dec 17 2021

As funds rebalance and close out positions before January, the low liquidity environment of VCRA will prompt large losses leading to more shorts covering.¬†

Shares outstanding: 34.8m (bloomberg)

Institutional shares: 31.7m-34m (bloomberg)

Float: 0-3m shares¬†

Short interest: 3.5m (FINRA)

Short interest % of float: 100% or greater

https://preview.redd.it/cisd401lgx681.png?width=4430&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b0929a26b32cd4cdd6daa1e2eefd8cf78ee6021

There are no incremental flows to this stock. The fundamental momentum pushing this stock higher is enough to create substantial gains in price due to shorts rebalancing alone. Factor in a gamma and vanna spike due to introducing options, and what results might have some fireworks.

**The contracts are priced with low volatility**

https://preview.redd.it/sgrkgctmgx681.png?width=2106&format=png&auto=webp&s=d689dcd1245e440b7c685a3ea3c38400f1043cbb

Historical vol is pretty low compared with the large daily moves. As an example, the 60c at close yesterday was $5.8 (b/e at $65.8), which we‚Äôre close to hitting already. The spreads are jumping around - some brokers don‚Äôt even show the correct numbers.¬†

Of course IV will increase as calls are purchased, but how the MM will react is unknown whether it is via purchasing shares or hedging volatility via selling other contracts. No contracts are being opened for Feb and beyond today so I‚Äôm assuming shares are being hedged.

**Positions**

https://preview.redd.it/04g9cnaogx681.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ad6ba3a63a2d1887cb3e734d4138c65f618084

\+ others and shares. This is a slow bleed up. My aim is to hold these through the 31st though moves can be quick and sudden in the near term.

Cheers

&#x200B;

**update 4pm**

Ortex data shows shorts continuing to close their positions while new shorts initiate, largely via sold calls which they then buy back because they're getting blown out. This happened during the pin at 65, where breaking it caused a lot of positive price action. As I said, my price target is well beyond the 70c. I expect new strikes to be opened this week.

Short borrow fee is 0.5% which suggest there is virtually no pressure to cover.

840k shares available to borrow on IBKR

ORTEX data is pure bullshit, I don't trust it at all, sorry.

*however*

Institutional ownership shows as over 100% on IBKR, which basically means super high as it's prob slightly out of date.

It does seem like it's heavily concentrated on institutions, by far.

Barrons reports SI as 3.5m shares, and the stock has a 250k daily volume, so that's a loooong time to cover..which is good for squeezing the price a bit.

The risk is if an inst investor decides to dump shares..

i don't think the company is worth more in terms of value, it's already met the analyst's price targets and that says something, as they usually overshoot. ***But*** the concentration, short interest and WSB momentum can force the price up for sure.

ImFedUpWithItAll,"1. ‚Å†institutional holdings are not out of date. They‚Äôve been over 100% for 8 straight years, and I explained above that it‚Äôs due to very large OTF holders.

**Holdings** ***cannot*** **exceed 100%. The reason they show as 100%+ is because different funds report at different times for different periods, so it never adds up properly at any specific date. Having said that, the fact that it shows consistent holdings at such high percentage suggests that it is, virtually all of it held by institutions. We don't disagree on that, but it's good to be factual unless you are implying fraud is taking place with the company's shares somehow.** 

2. ‚Å†CTB is .5% but that doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt believe price will go down, which it won‚Äôt in this case because they are quite simply too successful.

**CTB** ***does*** **matter because it can force shorts to cover vs. just kicking the can and keeping the position open. It's not the only variable but it's important. The expectation that the price will keep going up is just that, an expectation and may or may not materialize as the whole market may move for some bullshit such as omicron. A high CBT is real and hurts shorts every day regardless of expectations. Can't keep a short position open if you keep getting margin calls for higher collateral because CBT is rocketing every day, for example.**

3. ‚Å†I am confident you haven‚Äôt read their earnings transcript or multiple research reports where the big firms are repeatedly lauding VRCA‚Äôs ability at establishing high quality partnerships and SAS (recurring growth).

**No I have not. Regardless, the analysts have price targets which this share price has virtually met. We all know analysts usually target much higher than what the share price is as they do DCFs over several years. The fact it's hit the price target pretty much means there's little to no upside anymore unless an unforeseen catalyst 'happens'. Why would new investors buy into a share when it appears fully valued? What would they know the analysts who are covering it don't?**

4. ‚Å†SI is skewed to show 10% as a percentage of shares outstanding. However, as I explained above, nearly 100% of the 34.8m shares outstanding are held by long long term holders, which means the 3.5mil reported short interest as an enormous 100-300% of the float.

**I never said otherwise, I even said it'll take shorts a very long time to cover.**

5. ‚Å†Bonus; this stock is moving because it is incredibly illiquid due to lack of trading shares. 100 shares moves the price $0.1, and there are 3,500,000 shorts outstanding, a portion of which likely want to close before EOY.

**I sincerely hope so. Keep in mind though that illiquidity works the other way too, if your trade doesn't work and you want to exit you'll have to suck up a big spread.**",Araphoren
