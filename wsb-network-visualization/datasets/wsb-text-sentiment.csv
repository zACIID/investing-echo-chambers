"$F f150 lighting update - Ford sent an email to those 200k who reserved the f-150 lighting saying:

‚Äúmany of you won‚Äôt get a 2022 F‚Äë150 Lightning‚Ñ¢ truck‚Äù

They are not taking any more reservations and now they are saying they will not be able to deliver nearly 200k reserved.

What it means is that they are having massive production problems (hell Tesla went through) and now the moment of reckoning nears.

Deliveries will be delayed.  Reservations and some models will be cancelled

"You mean its not a good idea to follow financial youtube pump and dumpers advice? Lol

Now as for nio. I dont hold shares in the company anymore but i am bullish long term. I decided to take my funds and place elsewhere at the beginning of the year because i didnt see them moving too much this year. Never thought theyd dip down this hard. So im currently looking for a re entry around March 2022 as long as it stays sub 30 and hopefully china starts looking a little more safe for investors. We will see. Long term i think NIO has a bright future. Short term i wouldnt touch the options chain at all. The stock is just weirdly volatile in all the wrong ways. They release great PR it goes down. They do nothing it jumps up . The price action is just problematic from a options perspective. Unless you‚Äôre buying some 2 year leaps which at that point idk just buy shares lol

"Blackberry Beat Earnings and earnings analysis(The Good the bad and the misunderstood) - After taking a strong run yesterday up 4% Blackberry is trading 3% down after earnings.

**The Good: Complete earnings beat**  


* **Non-GAAP EPS**: US$0.00 (beat by US$0.07) last quarter they beat earnings by a mere. 01 and the stock surged.
* **GAAP EPS**: - US$0.05 (beat by US$0.11)
* **Revenue:** US$184m (beat by US$7.42)

**The Bad: Revenue Growth -17% Y/Y** 

Topline this number looks bad, many big tech names have Y/Y sales trending downwards, but for a growth company, this is simply a miss.  **The stock initially popped after hours on earnings beat, but then dropped on this information alone.** 

**The misunderstood:** 

Blackberry is at a transition point as a company moving away from its business of old to becoming more of a cybersecurity firm and automative software play. Guidance showed that cybersecurity is going to be its largest revenue source moving forward, but what's not discussed enough is its penetration into the automotive industry  


In the past month, BMW and M&M both announced agreements to use Blackberry's QNX technology in their vehicles.  They are now involved with 45 automotive companies and over 195 vehicles worldwide. **195 million vehicles worldwide?!?!** They are cornering the market and nobody seems to love the potential here! VW and Toyota both sell about 10 million cars a year, and yet that's nothing compared to their market penetrations

Furthermore, they have 707 million on cash on hand, and for a company valued at less than 5 bullion that is unheard of. They have the cash to execute their vision and the numbers to dominate the cybersecurity vehicle market.

This isn't a BB to the Moon DD, god knows we don't need another one of those. This is trying to get a grasp of earnings and an understanding of where the companies future lies  


I am not a financial advisor, nor is this financial advice.

Position: 2000 shares @ $9",0.9622

And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto the beast? who is able to make war with him?

I mean I would like to comment on something negative, but this sub is so biased everything you type (-) will instantly get downvoted and vanilla-countered, lol.  
  
For a company that has been hyped so much year-two years ago to see a declining revenue and 180 mil. for what - 6 mlrd. cap? Is quite weak and the transition that Chen is doing is taking what, 10 years already or so?  
  
Don't get me wrong, I am holding 3000 shares stuck at 12 bucks and I am in for a long term, but please quit with this biased documentation of how 'good' this is, because it ain't.  
  
The transition is quite slow and we are waiting for that patent sale already for more than a year. Remember how many posts and ideas were there literally spamming/claiming 'it's always the next month' basically?  
  
It's quite explainable why BB is stuck at the same price and why floor seems to be at 8 dollars or so. I doubt we will reach 30 bucks in the next few years, and I am being generous. We are worshiping a company that has reported lower and lower earnings for like several years in a row.  
  
Stay here if you believe in their process for 5-7 years at least, because if you are here for 1-2 years, hell even possibly 3, I believe there are way better investments.

TFX - Teleflex: Medical device company focused on urinary issues as well as fluid draining of lungs. They‚Äôre products are always in high demand for catheters etc. but Covid has really boosted lung product sales.

CTT - Catchmark Timber Trust: Owns and harvests on high quality timberlands that have been producing at high levels recently due to timber boom and housing boom.

ENR - Energizer Holdings: batteries. I like the chart and we‚Äôre heading into Christmas which is like battery pallooza for the industry.

FSS - Federal Signal Corporation: makes radios, sirens, speciality electronics for huge gvt police, fire military etc contracts. Great chart

MSGS - Madison Square Garden: great dip this month due to fears of closing nba and nhl seasons due to Covid. Msgs owns the knicks and the rangers and the garden itself. Rangers just set a record nhl valuation at $2 billion. That‚Äôs huge for an nhl team. Should move msgs significantly higher.

MBT - Mobile Telesystems: literally just riding the ups and waiting for super predictable dips on this one for the last 7 months. easy money honestly

NYT - New York Times: self explanatory. Great bullish set up right now.

STE - Steris: medical equipment company specializing in sterilization products for hospitals which has been awesome throughout Covid. Great chart and nice hedge for an unforeseen omicron wave.",0.9977

"I see so many potential problems with it. Maybe it's because I lost everything to an apartment fire that ended up collapsing due to the weight of the water, and that is really affecting how I am looking at this building. I cannot imagine if a serious accident were to happen in a building like this, where there are so few windows, could be a safe place to live. The bedrooms are tiny, the only space students would have to study and relax is a tiny desk. I'd be so depressed living there.

I understand that there is a serious housing shortage and people need to go to school. If something like this allows for students to actually survive college without eating a pack of ramen a day while UCSB plows them into debt, that's good I guess. I'm in a spot where I understand there is a problem very closely linked to low paid jobs for college students, ridiculous housing costs, lack of housing lose to campus, etc. Just really have an issue with the fact that UCSB has known about this problem for a very long time and continues to  admit more students than the area can actually reasonably care for. The design feels extremely exploitative and out of touch with the needs of students, especially with the lack of natural light (many students won't have a window at all) and space to be alone.  I'm sure UCSB has study spaces on campus, but really having your own space to relax is a must. Having so many roommates would've driven me up the wall. Plus having that many people living in such close quarters is just asking for a major covid outbreak if this thing actually goes up. The dude is *not* an architect.

[This chick](https://youtu.be/_zGlBd4HG2I) explains some of the reasons why I'm so hesitant about it. It just feels like an inhumane bandage to a complex problem. I cannot imagine 4500+ college students being crammed into those places. 8 people to a dorm is a lot as is. Hell, having 4 people in my dorm was difficult. My friends had it much worse with 6, shared rooms. I consider myself extremely fucking lucky that I was in a position where my university refused multi-occupant dorm rooms. We didn't have a lot of space, but we made it work. Not saying other dorms are any better at many colleges at all. 

We really need to start prioritizing the health and safety of students without price gouging them or shoving them into dorms like a bunch of rats. Just a shit situation that cannot be fixed easily. I feel like Munger's design would end up spreading. It is ""good enough"" but the priorities aren't in the right place (shocker). I do think something *like* this could work if the size shrunk, multiple buildings were made instead of one, and more attention was put into student needs. It isn't an easy problem to fix, not trying to be a realist, but you can't look at those rooms and think there's nothing that should be changed. Munger doesn't want changes. It is take the donation and the plans or leave it which is really fucked up. He does not care about fixing the student housing problem. He doesn't care about UCSB, the students, charity. He just wants to swing his lil chub around and put his name on a big building. I just really hope if this goes through, that the pricing will be *cheap*.

Edit: here's the [floorplan](https://www.noozhawk.com/images/made/images/uploads/113021-Munger-Hall-Design-UCSB-house-plan-rendering-jpg_1320_622_80_c1.jpg) for anyone wanting to see it. The video I linked above goes deeper into the plans.",0.8555

Yeah but at least it was fun. Reading the autistic stuff u/Variation-Separate used to write was fun. Seeing people throw their life safings into 4/17 SPY $180p was fun. And the bear trend lasted only a few months and was entirely justified by the fact that we were in the middle of an unprecedented market volatilty event of massive proportion. People in the sub knew that they were stupid, at least.

>There's occasional DD thats worth the time (like the guy that posted thePTON put YOLO) but it does take time to filter through, there's alsoenough loss porn and ridiculously lucky gain porn to be entertaining.

How is present-day loss porn entertaining? It's only entertaining if you have lost the money in an original stupid new way. And I don't see that very often any more. Idk man maybe I've just grown up too much for this and that's why I'm grumpy",0.9827

So you prefer this place consist of everyone making the same stupid trade and every comment on every post just be ""JpOW PrInTeR Go BRrRrR""? I guess we have different definitions of fun.

>How is present-day loss porn entertaining?

You have to look into it more. Yes a lot of people are just posting pictures of their red account with no information which is dumb. Just yesterday I commented on a post where an idiot bought ITM calls in a fucking video game stock at the absolute top. It turned bearish literally the next day and has fallen every day since while he holds the bags. Hilarious.
Thats what this place is about in my opinion, making fun of 22 year old retards that watched Wolf Of Wall Street too many times and have no clue what they are doing. Yes iR0nyman and the likes are few and far between but always have been. I think you are just looking back through rose colored glasses",0.8985

"Comparing ARK ETFs in 2020 to 2021 - https://www.theancienteconomist.com/post/the-ark-invest-etfs-comparing-2020-to-2021

In 2021, The Ark Innovation ETF is -21.11% YTD, The ARK Genomic Revolution ETF is down 32% YTD, and the ARK Fintech Innovation ETF is down 21% YTD. The one ARK ETF in the green is their Autonomous Tech& Robotics ETF, which is up about 8% YTD.


The ARK Innovation ETF ($ARKK) is the best play with regards to getting your best bet on a solid return. The top stocks encompassing the ETF are Tesla, Roku, Teladoc, Square, Zoom, Shopify, Coinbase, and Twilio, amassing nearly 50% of its value. 



What do you guys think? Which ARK ETF is in the best position for 2022? Surely ARK will not endure the same level of horrid returns next year as 2021.",0.9776

"If you‚Äôre looking for at least a 5 year investment (woods always talks about how they‚Äôre long term strategies) they‚Äôre all good buys.

I was just about to comment on $ROKU strength here. Definitely a lot of upside. The volatility on the options chain and this bullish basing pattern breaking selling pressure and reversing momentum make this a no brainer along some of the other $ARKK names.,0.296

"Yeah the rEbAlAnCiNg take is bs.  When she trims the Tesla position, that‚Äôs rebalancing.  But she also buys shit and sells it less than 12 months later.

"Exactly. The goal isn't to mimic the same returns they saw from a previous year (or two). Its about the long term. If you have to lose 20% in a year to ensure you are getting a better value in the long term, thats the cost of doing business. 

Look at someone like buffet. If he decided to ditch his big investments at 20% loss (or sometimes a lot more) he wouldn't have made the gains he has. Buying the dip is a very real strategy for any investor",0.7783
"If you look at the chart before 2020,  it‚Äôs not that impressive.",-0.4023
Impressive for a ETF. ARKK beginning of 2017 was $21 then in the beginning of 2019 it was $42. That‚Äôs insane growth especially for an ETF. Doubling your return in two years is way above the norm on investing. The S&P had one the best years on awhile and only saw a 25% return. Anything over 10% a year is a great return.,0.91
Why ignore the years that were flat before 2017?,-0.3612
The entire market was relatively flat from 2014- 2016. ARKK started in 2014. But yes from the start of the fund in 2014 till 2017 it didn‚Äôt see much growth.,0.7876

After a few days the pain will subside with time. And then looking back it'll only feel like the loss of a relative or family pet. Just don't think about all the vacations and things and experiences that money couldve gone to.

Think about all the years of $3k tax write offs you'll get.
More importantly, know that you will come back stronger, and this loss will eventually be all a write off against your larger, future gains.

Just don't quit options. Cuz then you'll be a quiter. And you miss 100% of the shots you never take - Michael Scott.

Happy holidays.",0.9134

Talk for awhile and casually take note of the people around you and see if anything looks off or you catch a couple guys looking over a little too often etc.

"Tracking CNBC Option Action Recommendation 2021 Profitability Results - Have you ever wondered how good the CNBC celebrity investment pundits perform on option trades? Are the experts better than just investing in a market index fund?

Over the last year, I've monitored every one of the CNBC Option Action recommended trades and discovered that on an overall basis, Melissa Lee, Mike Khouw, Carter Braxton Worth, and Tony Zhang did pretty well.

* Total 2021 Options Action trades - 117 of which 39% were profitable (excludes high risk trades)
* Total profit for the year 13% (but holding period is only 64 calendar days), so you can multiply profits throughout the year
* My Favorite trade of the year - June 4, 2021 Option Action show:
   * Sell AMC $65 straddle for $69 when stock price closed at $47.91 yielding a 633% profit in two weeks. This was during the meme stock mania.
* Best recent trade on CNBC Options Action trade
   * The October 15, 2021 show recommended to Buy a Call Butterfly expiring November 19th at $650/$680/$710 strikes
   * The net cost of the option was only $4.30 or for a single contract $430.
   * The stock closed at $678.80 on November 19, 2021 yielding a profit of 572%
* Best month of the year was November 2021 where there were 10 trades expiring, seven of which were profitable yielding a monthly gain of 127%.
* Worst month of the year was August 2021 where there were 9 trades expiring, eight of which lost money with a monthly loss of 41%.
* If one started in January, trading every one of the option recommendations, there was never a time where your original capital went negative. This is partially due to a great start in January 2021 with a 112% gain.

At least for 2021, the CNBC Option Action pundits did a pretty good job. Hopefully, this trend will continue into the future.",0.9951

"Opportunity: Low Retail Volume + High Short Interest - This setup with stocks that have low retail volume/interest + high short interest has the potential to be explosive. Let me explain.

I was watching a meet Kevin video (I know I'm a dumbass) and he brought up some data that he found with one of his expensive resources that is commonly used with big banks and hedge funds. Essentially, these institutions, since the gamester fiasco, pay extreme attention towards retail volume on stocks they're shorting. The examples that Kevin brought up were Corsair, Shift, and Lemonade. With these names, it appears that when retail begins buying the dips and pouring in, hedge funds quickly close their short positions in an attempt to minimize their losses or take profits, then, when retail interest dies down, they pile on with their shorts again.

I found this very intriguing as I believe it presents an extremely large opportunity. First, just the sight of a few retail investors pouring into stocks like this will cause these institutions to RAPIDLY close their short positions, the actual price movement may not even be that significant but when they observe data displaying a surge in retail volume, they will flee for the hills. Additionally, institutions at this time of year are looking to close short positions on stocks like CRSR, Shift, and LMND because they're already up a significant amount, the year is coming to an end, and they may be anticipating a Santa clause rally .

All of these factors lead me to believe that names with low retail volume and high short interest are extremely large opportunities at this moment. I personally like CRSR as it seems they have the best fundamentals compared to other names that fit this criteria but there may also be other opportunities out there.

What do ya'll think?

Is this strategy viable?

What are some other names that fall under this criteria?

**Additionally, I do not endorse any of these names, mods please do not take down my post, I put in genuine effort and I'm not trying to pump anything, just spreading a kinda cool strategy**",0.9883

I had plenty of time to get out with some profit, and despite recognizing what was going on, I still held because I'm an idiot. The funny thing is that it was one of those ""rainbow"" days, and if I'd held longer, I could have sold for minor profit by the end of the same day, but I was afraid it would keep going up and I didn't want to take that big of a hit. Obviously I still need to practice and not be an idiot, but optionstrat helped me a lot, and if I'd adhered to what I had learned from it, I wouldn't have taken that L.

"SPY to the Moon - **Prediction Feb 18th:** $535-540 \*not financial advice\*

**Postions: Attached**

&#x200B;

Looking at the chart you will notice SPY has been trading flat for around 50 days. SPY has never done this before (rare). Very heavy price consolidation = breakout soon

During an uptrend, the RSI tends to stay above 30 and should frequently hit 70. During a downtrend, it is rare to see the RSI exceed 70, and the indicator frequently hits 30 or under.

&#x200B;

The recent sell-off/loss momentum in trend in my opinion was because of Evergrande/Debt Ceiling/No Stimmy, just overall a dried-up economy. Every earnings shit the bed, I hated my life being a perma-bull. Then I noticed how in the world is SPY trading flat for legit 2 months? SPY has never done this before. So I did some research and noticed the following. This new covid variant is a literal covid bull run again. Our gov won't let the economy crash when the ICU at hospitals are filling up faster than they have ever before.

&#x200B;

**No taper + Rate hikes + Stimmy (Look at EU data excluding England, they are retarded)**

&#x200B;

There is a literal ladder attack on SPY. Mofos keeping it under ATH so they profit shorting. Looking at the data you will notice this major bull flag with Biden's Build Back Better bill about to pass.

&#x200B;

**Failed to Deliver**

Date: 11/30

SPY Price: $464.60

The number of shares: 4,735,862

Value of shares in USD: $2,200,281,485.20

[https://ibb.co/xFwpRCc](https://ibb.co/xFwpRCc)

&#x200B;

You read that correct, legit $2.2 BILLION in shares have been failed to deliver. So it is under my assumption when Dems use reconciliation (pass BBB) without intervention this short will want to buy shares NOT at a higher price compared to what they shorted (since the low probability of SPY being stuck between $450-$473 again).

&#x200B;

This means SPY will likely gamma once it's greater than $464.60. Look at the IV of 12/31 deep OTM calls and you will understand why they aren't worthless. In order for this to happen people must buy shares and hold (likely based on SPY price consolidation).

&#x200B;

**Probability**

Very high in my opinion. 10 million in buy orders on no news yesterday, 2 million buy orders today at the close of the trading day, and an options trader bet $65 million on deep OTM calls exp before x mas. Who would do this without knowing anything? Probably Pelosi IMO.

"I once met up with a friend whose dad was a union rep.  Let me tell you his house was hooked up.  This was the early 2000s I believe and all I remember was that he had this giant remote control thing that controlled everything in his homes from the blinds to the gigantic tv to the lighting in his room.  After we left I asked the friend what their dad did and that‚Äôs when I found out being a union rep pays.

Second person I met that actually worked for a union was a neighborhood childhood friends mom.  Worked in a union her entire life as a secretary to the boss and she just said flat out that they are corrupt as shit.  It‚Äôs a family racket where they hire relatives and just give these positions big salaries and they don‚Äôt do shit for it.  I had really no opinion either way and she was retired but she was happy to retire and not deal with the nepotism apparently.

But as an adult, I now realize why the Mob is so big on unions.",0.7143

Unions are capitalistic.  If there wasn‚Äôt profit in it for them they wouldn‚Äôt give 2 fucks about workers rights.  Unions are just in it to create a separate ‚Äúcare class‚Äù that does little but exist off the wage earnings of the working class that they subordinate through promises.,0.714

"They didn't even give the new workers a chance. I've worked factory jobs it takes like 2 months to be decent. 

Knowing factory workers they probably sabotaged the machinery just enough on the way out to make it not work perfect.

"In the sense that politicians promise you a workers utopia if you give them money, and then barely anything changes but now you're forced to continue giving them money whether you like it or not; and that they sound great on paper but tend to not be so great in reality.

They're basically an HOA but for your job. It has it pros and cons though: on the one hand you have to pay dues regardless of how you feel about the union... on the other hand it can make it a bitch to fire you unless you break clearly defined rules repeatedly and it's documented. Honestly depends on the industry and how good the union is.",0.9806

"Incorrect.  I‚Äôve worked and have been part of a union.  It was a grocery store.  I had zero option to opt out.  I had to pay my dues and it was automatically deducted from my check.  I could opt out of being represented but they still got to keep my dues.  I worked less than 20 hours a week.  It was a bullshit job working at the Pharmacy during my retail college years.  Seniority is based on the number of years you worked there.  So I actually ended up making less money because of the union.  

Imagine that.  Oh and the grocery store was Safeway.",-0.714

And unions are not meant to help part time workers in college either.. they are for full time career people.

Or the comradery of I'll throw this to you and you stack it on that skid while we wait for the fork lift. Dean's on tonight and you know he's slow as fuck and we won't make incentive if we don't.,0.4019
"In a good union place yes. But in general better than retail, fast food and things like that but not much better. It's not a high skill job so lots of people are qualified so that makes it hard to find a good one. Also if you're good paying factory closes up shop and moves you're fucked (you have learned very few skills and the ones you have learned are pretty much eaaily picked up or a specific to the place that just closed) especially if you're over 45. So if you have the opportunity get a skill trade or go to post secondary education in a field that is in demand. 

I would only recommend factory work to dumb people (they're qualified) or someone that's stuck in a situation like 2 kids no high school diploma and 19. Even then apprenticeships usually pay well enough I'd say stick it out in there well you get your GED and apply at every skill trade place around (plumber, electrician, carpenter, HVAC and things like that). Being a skill trade in a factory isn't bad though if the factory you're in closes up shop your skills are indemand and lots of other places will hire you.",0.9636

costs passed to consumers not impacting margin - bullish  
before you go on about people not buying their products, this has been ongoing for weeks and they are still selling so its unlikely to be a factor going forward.",-0.1531
"Output was apparently not affected to the point of shortage during the entirety of the strike.

But now the output costs more to produce.  Which was my point.  Kelloggs isn't just going to reduce compensation for executives to make up the difference in higher costs for line workers, instead they'll shrink product size and/or increase product cost to the consumer.",0.3447

BB is based in Canada, EPS have been all over the place, are trying to reinvent themselves as a software/cybersecurity company after being founded 37 years ago and publicly traded for 22 years.

The street favors new, exciting, US based, profitable companies due to less risk. Crowdstrike is that and BB is not right now.",0.9851

"Well, thats stock only works on marketing, they spent 150Musd in maketing this year. That company never made any profit the past 10 years, i dont see any reason for this to change. Some of the contracts they recently secured was thru spac and nobody knows how they will get paid for those. To me it is a scam, but poeple are so naive sometimes that they could keep on buying, you never know....Poeple probably thought it would fly like snowflakes but it did not until now.",-0.2535

ISRAELI DEFFENCE AND SELF SMART GROCCERY SHOPPING CART JUST LISTED TO NASDAQ. - [removed],0.4019
"Markets at close: 12/21/2021 - **Today in brief**

**S&P: 4,649.23 (+81.21) (+1.78%)**

**Dow: 35,492.70 (+560.54) (+1.60%)**

**Nasdaq: 15,341.09 (+360.14) (+2.40%)**

Following the rout yesterday, Global stock markets were on the upswing today and the same was reflected in the US markets. The indices recouped the Monday losses and closed above Friday‚Äôs (12/17) close though nothing much has changed in terms of the concerns on the Omicron variant, which is fast becoming the dominant variant throughout the US and the World. Even with the cases rising and restrictions increasing, the general public is in a much better position to handle this new variant; vaccinations and general awareness on masks and social distancing is sure to help this leg of the pandemic to be in the rear-view mirror with much less damage.

Shares of Micron Technology was up by more than 10% following its beat of topline and EPS in its Q1 earnings and the subsequent strong chip demand forecast. The company‚Äôs shares have been trading sideways this year but has been attracting lots of attention on its DRAM and NAND Flash storage.

EV Company and pandemic-era favorite Nikola will pay a fine of $125 Mn in settlement with SEC over alleged false claims by Nikola‚Äôs ex-CEO Trevor Milton. Nikola neither accepted nor denied the claims of Milton in terms of the settlement. Nikola currently trades above $9 which is a fraction of $70+ it traded in mid-2020s. Hindenburg‚Äôs damaging report and the subsequent watered-down deal with GM reversed the tides for this stock.

Another meme stock, WISH, jumped up by more than 14% today. For the year though the ecommerce stock is down by more than 80%.

Airlines and Cruise stocks were all up today with DAL (+5.9%), AAL (+4.7%), UAL (+6.9%), CCL (+8.7%) and RCL (+5.4%) significantly in the green following a positive report by Bank of America. According to the report, domestic bookings have been largely resilient in the face of Omicron thus far with more softness in the international bookings. Cruise stocks continued the momentum on the favorable commentary by the management of CCL yesterday.",0.9558

Any amount of money you contribute to a Roth IRA can be taken out at any time without taxes. You would only be penalized for taking *Gains* out. So if you contribute 50k over the years and that‚Äôs now worth 100k you can take your 50k out tax and penalty free. The other 50k of gains would be subjected to early withdraw penalties if you were to take those out. The downside to taking out contributions is that you can only deposit it back in at the yearly max which is currently 6k a year (7k if your over 55),0.6124

">	I made a sincere effort to look for counter DD, looking at it against the DD in favour of GME

Because they‚Äôre a video games retailer in which video game software is moving to being completely digital, in which they bring nothing to the table. They‚Äôre a retailer that as of today has logistics that are so far behind Amazon, Target, Walmart, and even fucking Best Buy that there is nothing to suggest they‚Äôll catch up to any reasonable degree. 


Anecdotally I‚Äôve preordered two popular items from them this year and they seem to have still not figured out release day shipping.


Anytime you bring these incredibly basic issues with their company the response is a lot of fingers in the ear and telling people to read a nonsensical 34 paragraph wankjob on a subreddit dedicated to only that stock, that amounts to ‚Äúit‚Äôs gonna be the biggest retailer in the world believe me bro‚Äù",0.9506

Where is the money in that? And if there is money in that where is the moat that prevents other retailers from doing the same?

>	Or when you buy a digital switch/ps5 game, how do you like the option to trade it away in the future just like a physical trade-in? 

About as much as I do now, which is ‚Äúalmost never except for when I want to get rid of physical items I don‚Äôt care about because they‚Äôre taking up more space than they‚Äôre worth.‚Äù Console platforms have had the resources to implement this for a long time, they reason they haven‚Äôt done it is because there is literally no money in this. Furthermore they can all simply refuse to generate or sell digital keys of their game on any other platform, like publishers are doing on Steam/Epic and like Sony is doing with PlayStation games.

She's on top of you, voraciously pumping up and down over and over again on your rock hard 4.5 inches of man meat. You're both covered in sweat. Her breasts are smothering your face and you are lapping up every droplet of sweat from the tips her nipples. One of your hands is fingerings her ass and the other is tightly gripping her hip. Her hands are gripping the back of your shoulders with nails piecing the skin and your back hair intertwined with her fingers. You feel like you're going to cum and are fighting it because you want to enjoy every moment. She keeps saying ""you're so hard, you make me so wet, you're such a man"". You can feel a mixture of sweat and feminine fluids running through your pubes and dripping down the inside of your thighs. Eventually, you can't take it anymore, you cum. Luckily, at the same time, she screams in ecstacy, leaving claw marks on your back and ripping out large handfuls of hair. She screams ""you're such a sexy buuuuuullllllllll!!!!!""

After finishing the orgasm, She roles off of you and rests silently for a few moments before asking ""can I see your Robinhood account? I couldn't help but overhear you talking with your friends about all the calls you bought during the dip"". You get nervous but open up Robinhood on your phone and show her the account (account is filled with puts). Her expression instantly turns to agitation. She says ""what the fuck? You said you were a permabull???"" You freeze up and try to speak but all that comes out is rambling about recessions, inflation, rising interest rates, etc. She throws the phone at your face, which gives you a black eye, and screams ""get fuck out of my house you ghey bear!!!"" You jump up, quickly dress, and exit the home. 

Sitting in your car, you lament your loss. After many years of mostly being celibate, you thought you had found the one. Driving home, you keep thinking over and over, ""why am I such a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà üêª?...""",-0.9001

"I figured out why musk did the twitter poll and that he was honest when he said he would abide by the results, no matter what the result was.

He was gonna dump a massive amount of shares either way and rather than shock the world when the news of him actually selling broke, he decided to do it himself in meme fashion. That way when he actually started selling it wouldn‚Äôt really be big news and truly crash Tesla before he had enough time to get out.

The funny part is both answers were true. If it had been ‚Äúno‚Äù him selling something like 50% would still be ‚Äúabiding by the results‚Äù and the way he structured his sells incrementally would make it look like he was selling <10% at first. By the time people realized he was selling more, it would have given him enough time to sell a huge amount without Tesla crashing.

With ‚Äúyes‚Äù it‚Äôs the same thing - small incremental sells would be very minor news in comparison with the tweet news and once he passes 10% it‚Äôs still ‚Äúabiding by the results‚Äù because he **did** sell 10%, he just didn‚Äôt stop there.

I think it'll dip under 200 before it tops 350 again, but it could do both in the next month or two depending on how covid goes.  

Long term, I'd be more comfortable betting on them getting FDA approval on more and more applications of their base tech.  MRNA is still going to be a low float biotech company and very prone to pumping on a single news story.  Additionally last I checked they have around $9B cash and \~3B quarterly revenue, which makes me think that at least while most of the world is desperate for Covid vaccines, they are not going to need to offer more shares to raise capital for expansion soon.

I'd say wait for a good entry, say after a long slow bleed because Omicron is being handled and go in for 2024 leap calls if you are going to be placing LEAPs on MRNA, but thats just me.",0.9522

"So they're like most every other company releasing a highly complicated product for the first time?

Good to know.

That ultra rich dude who buys this car is probably SUPER picky about damn near everything he buys?

Good to know.

The fact that the review itself, written by an owner, specifically states ""This will likely get better with software updates"" multiple times about most of the ""negative"" stuff he discussed?

Also good to know.

The fact that replies to the original review often points to the fact that the owner apparently didn't RTFM on his 175k car? I get that 175k should be intuitive, but cars are intuitive because there are decades of use and habits to look at of god only knows how many drivers.

Not to say software is not as equally important. However it's a lot easier to patch crappy software than it is to patch a poorly engineered platform. 

If there are widespread issues arising from the software then a dip may follow, but as far as being a product ending issue, this isn't it. 

That being said if Lucid does nothing over the next 6 months to a year to resolve these issue THEN would be the time to start growing concerned. But as it stands this just appears to be growing pains.

"China Omicron Bear Thesis... - China's method of dealing with COVID is zero tolerance.  It will lockdown an entire city over a few cases. As a result very few Chinese have had any covid -- they're all covid virgins.  Their vaccine provides almost no protection against Omicron infection, and is far less effective against COVID generally as our MRNA vaccines.  The reason for their strict controls is that their own analysis is that their hospitals would be overrun if Covid got out of control.

Now the omicron variant is up to 70x more contagious.  Cramer got it, and then gave it to his co-host while testing negative.  The tests don't pick it up fast enough to stop the spread.  The US headlines say it went from 3% of cases to 73% in this country in just a week.  Hard to believe, but if that's remotely true how can it be stopped?  I doubt no matter how strict China is that they will be able to contain Omicron, and even if they do it will only be due to resorting to extreme lockdowns.

It doesn't matter that Omicron is less fatal, China only known response is zero tolerance lockdowns.  Omicron is like the gate-crasher variant, it may overrun the system with positives, hospitalizations, making it harder to prevent the spread of other variants which China has kept out thus far and which they have no immunity and only a partially effective vaccine against normal COVID.

"As someone who was there for initial breakout (my city was immediately after Wuhan), it'll be controlled. We're talking welding or magnetically sealing people inside their apartments if they've even come in contact with anyone who has come in contact with anyone who has gotten COVID. They do multiple layers of contact tracing. Every place makes you scan in (well...some people get lazy when they know you being there every day), and they force tests of entire cities if there is a breakout anywhere, regardless of geography (also went through this). When I was there, they even raised quarantine to 3 weeks for a few months. I left because I tend to like my family and want to see them and it was exhausting. Just not worth it, plus the propaganda was turned up to 11. Anyway. I just don't see it spreading. They already controlled Omicron in Hangzhou (friend there) and Ningbo (other friend). I should also state that if you are from a city with an outbreak, there is a good chance you will be banned from airplanes or even airports depending.

"The only good thing about Omicron is that the rapid infections means we are getting closer to herd immunity.

Maybe it's almost a blessing in disguise.

Honestly, considering the world population proved that a large enough of them refuse to take the vaccine, maybe next time it would be better if governments just let us get ravaged by the next pandemic unless that virus has an insane kill rate. It seems like herd immunity through natural means and not a vaccine might have been the ""best"" way to deal with this pandemic. 

Although, if the government decided that, I wonder if the population would then start begging for vaccines/help instead of being abandoned by the government. Human behavior is weird. We are constantly wishing for the other option. 

In terms of economics, lockdowns have fucked us mostly because we did not vaccinate fast enough. It's a case of the cure being worse than the disease.",0.2431
"I have been thinking this same thing.

There is only 2 ways this can end for China:

1. They continue the zero covid policy, lockdown the country over and over again until the economy goes to shit. This is especially hard considering they have the winder Olympics next year and a ton of foreigners are coming.


2. Covid (likely omicron) runs through the country like never seen before as vaccines aren‚Äôt really stopping the spread, and Chinese vaccine is shown to have almost no effect on omicron. This means, chinas time to dance with covid is coming. They will have far fewer deaths, but considering how contagious omicron is, it will run through China in record pace and even if 1 in 2000 people die, it running through even half of Chinese population in 1 month means 250,000 deaths. That will grind the country‚Äôs healthcare system to a halt. 

Everywhere else, people have been getting covid in waves which has artificially provided time. Omicron will create a wave like never before in China and even if it is less fatal, just the shear number of cases will overwhelm any healthcare system. 

Interesting couple of years ahead for China",-0.8275

We already live with multiple other strains of Sars-covid viruses. Even the WHO, believe what they say or not, claim that only two viruses have been eradicated by humans and the work of vaccines. Smallpox is the only one that is found in humans. The other is a bovine virus. So, even with the medical breakthroughs of mRNA vaccines and looking back at the work of the flu vaccines, we've seen no other viruses eradicated by any means since 1980. The variola major virus still exists, humans will rarely be infected with smallpox but it doesn't mean we actually killed the virus from still existing in nature. Yes, limiting human contact will no doubt limit transmission opportunities for any contagion but is that a way to fully live ones life? I hope you stick true to your words and have locked yourself down permanently until things change. Even if the rest of the world isn't in if you believe it's what needs done, you must live your beliefs if you want to say shit like that on Reddit.",-0.8444
"Ok, thank you. I'm very much the opposite of a covid doomer but I bet if there's a lot of evidence that even the oversensitive PCR tests are missing contagious omicron, 2020 will look like a trial run in terms of government action. Hoping it doesn't come to that.",0.5267

"Depends on the mutation. It could also mutate to be more infectious, yet less deadly, like the cold. 

I believe Omicron is actually weaker than Delta, but it spreads like crazy. Still deadly though as there have been cases of people dying from Omicron.

While I preferred that everyone got vaccinated, I've kind of given up on hoping people would. If I was in charge, I would have to either force everyone to get vaccinated, or just let the pandemic do its thing so everyone is naturally immune by the end of it. 

Considering how the population acted during covid, I'm pretty sure the latter would be what they prefer. People are stupid. Might as well give us what we deserve. At least they will be either happy or dead.",0.8516

Rather than a salary, Elon's compensation from Tesla comes in stock options so that a large portion of his net worth is in Tesla stock rather than liquid currency or other assents.  His contract with Tesla has 20-something million shares in performance incentive stock options with a strike price of $6.24 built in for compensation.  He's hitting those incentives and getting the opportunity to buy Tesla stock at $6.24/share.  If he exercises all of those options, it'll leave him with a huge capital gain for the year and a $12B tax bill.  He can fund that in one of two ways:  1) Sell enough Tesla stock to cover the bill OR 2) use some of stock as collateral.  He's taken Option 2 in the past.  This time he's taking option 1.",0.979

Rich people aren't sitting around with $20B in cash or they wouldn't remain rich for decades.

Income is earned $ from working (salary, compensation packages etc) or when they sell their assets - their cost basis on those assets.

Rife with worker abuse and underpaying employees. It's one big ""got mine"" mentality where the early starters are drowning in overvalued stock while late joiners get personally abused and fired by elon to satiate his ego. Contrsct work in silicon valley is hell, and elon took fucking notes.

Nevermind how it's actual a crap ev company that has managed to continuously lose its head start advantage at every step of the way, even with near limitless funding through overvalued stock, oh and one that hd to rely on corporate socialism to keep afloat. Real stable company model.

>At the end, everyone person is out for themselves

Every time I hear this it's the same projection. No, plenty of people just want to be comfortable without stepping on any toes. It's the greedy fucks who've introduced hussle culture as the norm who've turned morality into a poor man's quality. And the reality is that you wont be rich acting like them, because you're not in the in-group.

And he's made dirty millionaires. There is literally trillions of dollars locked up in a stock that is conpletely ballooned and bubbled out of proportion. Money isn't created out of thin air, and most rich assholes took the hint a long time ago to keep away from tsla or ride the bubble, not push against it.

They are masters of pulling out early, and elon will easily have access to those resources. When tsla shocks the market with its pop, it will cause exponentially more destitute individuals than it does or will 1%-ers.

"You are incorrect.  When you excercise the option you immediately owe the realized gain between current price and the option strike.  In Elon's case you are looking at a current price over $900 and his strike I believe was like $6.25/ share.

He could then owe additional tax when he sells the share between the price he acquire the share for and the then current price. 

 It works the same as RSU (restricted stock units).  I used to get them when I worked at Adobe. I always received a locked in price or 15% less than market whichever was lower.  Adbe would recognize my RSU at the vesting price as income which became my cost basis moving forward. I then owed more tax when I sold at anything over my cost basis.",0.6908

"VCRA - the Boomer Rip: +100% institution holds & low IV hedges - This is happening real-time (read: now) so I‚Äôm going to get right to the point.¬†

Vocera (VCRA) provides and sells wireless solutions (software and hardware) to hospitals and various industries. They‚Äôre profitable and doing great. More later.¬†

What you need to know is that shorts are closing for EOY rebalance. This is a huge problem for them as institutions hold so much of the stock that the trading float is literally virtually 0. The liquidity is so bad that even small shorts closing out are spiking all time highs. Meanwhile, calls are very cheap since nobody knows about this boomer stock. Open interest on the Jan exp is effectively 0 and implied vol is only **50%\***.¬†

https://preview.redd.it/iza3o24fgx681.jpg?width=2732&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4acdffef8cda14bb9736c233d18404360b430ce1

As shares and calls are purchased, I am betting on a sustained bleed up of closing shorts, low liquidity, and OTF long term holders who aren‚Äôt selling. My aim is far beyond the 70c strike.¬†

Summary

* **Non-existent float**: The entire float is held by long-term OTF holders who aren‚Äôt selling (largest 30 firms own 92% of all shares). This is very important.
* **Short rebalance**: Short shorts are in the process of closing out by EOY rebalance and are spiking the price to ATH.
* **Historical IV has been low while the daily moves are high.** IV is 50%. Calls are cheap for where I believe the price will go. As an example, the 60c at close yesterday was $5.8 (b/e at $65.8), which we‚Äôre close to hitting already.
* **Continual upgrades:** Firms are exacerbating the process by issuing upgrades encouraging new longs to buy.

**About**

Vocera (VCRA) offers the leading platforms for workflow and communication. They create and sell both softwares and hardwares to healthcare professionals and many retail service enterprises. They are killing it.

Vocera is deployed in nearly 20% of all U.S. hospitals. Their expanded deployments, while aggressive, have only been matched by further company developments. For example, VCRA‚Äôs pivot to software-led enterprise sales was utilized in a Cleveland Clinic expansion in Q3 as one example in their second largest deal ever signed. They have been winning contract after contract flawlessly.¬†

VCRA delivered a nearly perfect Q3 with revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS beating consensus estimates. FY21 was raised for the **3rd** time this year.¬†

Recent upgrades include:

Dec 20: [Hallum $71 outperform¬†](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Vocera+Communications+%28VCRA%29+PT+Raised+to+%2471+at+Craig-Hallum/19372456.html?classic=1)

Nov 29: [Sandler $68 overweight](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nyse-vcra-a-buy-or-sell-right-now-2021-11-2-3/)

Nov 22: [BTIG $70 buy](https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3415040&headline=VCRA-Vocera-price-target-raised-to--from--at-BTIG)

So what, great company? Well firms have been loading up nonstop and now we have yet another fully share-utilized company.¬†

**Eight Years of +100% Institutional Holdings = null float**

https://preview.redd.it/0iqoq2lggx681.png?width=3167&format=png&auto=webp&s=5094a59c6c4df77b1a54559a567fdbd83a194841

Institutional holdings have shown +100% for 8 consecutive years because so many of the firms are OTF holders who won‚Äôt sell. This is very important. The 30 biggest funds hold and have been holding 31.7m shares (**that‚Äôs 92% of all outstanding shares**) for years now. They won‚Äôt be selling anytime soon. These funds hold for 5, 10, 20 years. I included the share history below. Note that there are no lock-ups expiring. There are no warrants. There is no convertible share trap waiting to explode. It is simply a small float.

https://preview.redd.it/fp6fwjoigx681.png?width=3164&format=png&auto=webp&s=fb6f6f623552e0560ff1db2fe1833ab0739d018c

I‚Äôll say it again: the largest buyers aren‚Äôt selling and leave less than 3m (true number is closer to 0) shares for shorts to purchase to cover their shares.¬† Lower float = lower liquidity = stronger moves.¬†

**Rally into EOY**

>‚ÄúOne should note that large short positions likely need to be closed before January, which is likely to see a small-cap, value and cyclical rally‚Ä¶ We believe these conditions are not met, and hence this market episode may end up in a short and cyclical rally into year-end and January.‚Äù - [JP Morgan‚Äôs Kolanovic](https://www.yahoo.com/now/ark-picks-advance-while-jpmorgan-205404568.html), Dec 17 2021

As funds rebalance and close out positions before January, the low liquidity environment of VCRA will prompt large losses leading to more shorts covering.¬†

Shares outstanding: 34.8m (bloomberg)

Institutional shares: 31.7m-34m (bloomberg)

Float: 0-3m shares¬†

Short interest: 3.5m (FINRA)

Short interest % of float: 100% or greater

https://preview.redd.it/cisd401lgx681.png?width=4430&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b0929a26b32cd4cdd6daa1e2eefd8cf78ee6021

There are no incremental flows to this stock. The fundamental momentum pushing this stock higher is enough to create substantial gains in price due to shorts rebalancing alone. Factor in a gamma and vanna spike due to introducing options, and what results might have some fireworks.

**The contracts are priced with low volatility**

https://preview.redd.it/sgrkgctmgx681.png?width=2106&format=png&auto=webp&s=d689dcd1245e440b7c685a3ea3c38400f1043cbb

Historical vol is pretty low compared with the large daily moves. As an example, the 60c at close yesterday was $5.8 (b/e at $65.8), which we‚Äôre close to hitting already. The spreads are jumping around - some brokers don‚Äôt even show the correct numbers.¬†

Of course IV will increase as calls are purchased, but how the MM will react is unknown whether it is via purchasing shares or hedging volatility via selling other contracts. No contracts are being opened for Feb and beyond today so I‚Äôm assuming shares are being hedged.

**Positions**

https://preview.redd.it/04g9cnaogx681.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d9ad6ba3a63a2d1887cb3e734d4138c65f618084

\+ others and shares. This is a slow bleed up. My aim is to hold these through the 31st though moves can be quick and sudden in the near term.

Cheers

&#x200B;

**update 4pm**

Ortex data shows shorts continuing to close their positions while new shorts initiate, largely via sold calls which they then buy back because they're getting blown out. This happened during the pin at 65, where breaking it caused a lot of positive price action. As I said, my price target is well beyond the 70c. I expect new strikes to be opened this week.

https://preview.redd.it/ipelhfgqmy681.png?width=1636&format=png&auto=webp&s=d56a29cff4aeea72cc2a88c11be7c9eed5baf5cc

"revenue and profits are down QoQ

Short borrow fee is 0.5% which suggest there is virtually no pressure to cover.

840k shares available to borrow on IBKR

ORTEX data is pure bullshit, I don't trust it at all, sorry.

*however*

Institutional ownership shows as over 100% on IBKR, which basically means super high as it's prob slightly out of date.

It does seem like it's heavily concentrated on institutions, by far.

Barrons reports SI as 3.5m shares, and the stock has a 250k daily volume, so that's a loooong time to cover..which is good for squeezing the price a bit.

The risk is if an inst investor decides to dump shares..

i don't think the company is worth more in terms of value, it's already met the analyst's price targets and that says something, as they usually overshoot. ***But*** the concentration, short interest and WSB momentum can force the price up for sure.

I literally just bought in about 400 in options contracts at Webull and then bought in about 200 and options for February in TD they seem to work‚Ä¶ Going back to buy shares in Webull on principle,0.296
"1. ‚Å†institutional holdings are not out of date. They‚Äôve been over 100% for 8 straight years, and I explained above that it‚Äôs due to very large OTF holders.

**Holdings** ***cannot*** **exceed 100%. The reason they show as 100%+ is because different funds report at different times for different periods, so it never adds up properly at any specific date. Having said that, the fact that it shows consistent holdings at such high percentage suggests that it is, virtually all of it held by institutions. We don't disagree on that, but it's good to be factual unless you are implying fraud is taking place with the company's shares somehow.** 

2. ‚Å†CTB is .5% but that doesn‚Äôt matter if you don‚Äôt believe price will go down, which it won‚Äôt in this case because they are quite simply too successful.

**CTB** ***does*** **matter because it can force shorts to cover vs. just kicking the can and keeping the position open. It's not the only variable but it's important. The expectation that the price will keep going up is just that, an expectation and may or may not materialize as the whole market may move for some bullshit such as omicron. A high CBT is real and hurts shorts every day regardless of expectations. Can't keep a short position open if you keep getting margin calls for higher collateral because CBT is rocketing every day, for example.**

3. ‚Å†I am confident you haven‚Äôt read their earnings transcript or multiple research reports where the big firms are repeatedly lauding VRCA‚Äôs ability at establishing high quality partnerships and SAS (recurring growth).

**No I have not. Regardless, the analysts have price targets which this share price has virtually met. We all know analysts usually target much higher than what the share price is as they do DCFs over several years. The fact it's hit the price target pretty much means there's little to no upside anymore unless an unforeseen catalyst 'happens'. Why would new investors buy into a share when it appears fully valued? What would they know the analysts who are covering it don't?**

4. ‚Å†SI is skewed to show 10% as a percentage of shares outstanding. However, as I explained above, nearly 100% of the 34.8m shares outstanding are held by long long term holders, which means the 3.5mil reported short interest as an enormous 100-300% of the float.

**I never said otherwise, I even said it'll take shorts a very long time to cover.**

5. ‚Å†Bonus; this stock is moving because it is incredibly illiquid due to lack of trading shares. 100 shares moves the price $0.1, and there are 3,500,000 shorts outstanding, a portion of which likely want to close before EOY.

**I sincerely hope so. Keep in mind though that illiquidity works the other way too, if your trade doesn't work and you want to exit you'll have to suck up a big spread.**",0.997
