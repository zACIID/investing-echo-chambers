"DNUT - victory, but an IV crush, breakout confirmation and more TA/DD - Many have already seen my DNUT DD which was correct down to the last word. However they did what no one expected them to do which is RAISE PRICES AGAIN!!!

the last time they announced a price raise the stock price went up roughly 25% over the course of 3 days, the price raise in September paid off so well that they decided to raise again. In terms of technical analysis we broke out and are backtesting, if we rebound here we should head to the channels breakout target which is around $16, as for my positions I had $100 left in cash after losing all my money on other trades so I bought more 15c on the IV crush, this isnt magic beans or some miracle stock so I dont expect to see it moon in one day. the average price for me became $28 cuz i bought super cheap and was up about 100% on todays peak but im holding until at least $17 

&#x200B;

[the channel target is measured by taking the width of the channel and putting it on the breakout point, this aligns perfectly with the R3 resistance](https://preview.redd.it/73lc1nd0ksy71.png?width=1056&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bec24adb784c9044d508184cb4309aec4aca0a1)

&#x200B;

[on the 15min we seem to be bottoming out as well so this would make for a good entry](https://preview.redd.it/otmdfhx9ksy71.png?width=1061&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac6a9bc1859f2c669e124c001dd032e15eeeb6d)

In total I have 10 contracts expiring next week with $15 strike, Im feeling optimistic especially since they are raising prices again, they stated that consumers are willing to pay 50% more for the specialty donuts so the price hikes can go a long way in terms of investing in shares but im here just betting on short term price action. A smart person would wait till closure before buying a closure above 14.15 would be the proper bullish confirmation here in terms of technical analysis on the larger frames. I think it can run 25-50% but I would def cash out at $20 with some profit taking at $17.

&#x200B;

This is not financial advice, as proven historically by my post history I am indeed retarded and am down lots of money. its just an online record of the someday redemption arc of mine where I will turn profitable and make my losses and some profit back



Edit: if you notice my comment below, yes I believe there is one and one short seller or entity only. They are fat whales but there is only one and there is a short borrow fee. Right now they are somewhere in the 6 stages of grief, shorting an ER like this with new price hikes is likely the anger stage, they could also be in the bargaining stage by doubling down. Depression is when they sell, acceptance and meaning is when they either leave the stock for good or if they switch to calls. They can also switch bullish during the bargaining stage in which case they’d be successful in bargaining. There is a short borrow fee, they are burning money imo, just a matter of how long right now. $20 soon though",0.9869

"I like your passion, is 11/19 $17.50 the move still?",0.6705
"I got $15c for 11/19, switched positions around, gambled with other plays and got burned lol. Had abt $250 this morning in it (after throwing my last $100 cash in), contracts did triple in value but I held cuz I was pretty bullish. Tbh looking at the chart now I’d be careful gambling on 11/19 17.5c but for December the 17.5 are a good play imo. They are raising prices again for this quarter... they raised prices two quarters in a row and said ppl willing to pay 50% more so its a good long over all. It got shorted a lot today and bagholders sold. Pretty similar to BBBY chart except this one does have some future as a company lol. I still think good chances we can run to $15 by EOW and $17 by next week but it’s a small stock with low liquidity and market cap so price is easy to manipulate. One order of 2k shares moved the stock up 1% in AH for a reference point as to how easy it is to manipulate. 

If I somehow survive and still have money I’ll be longing for Q4 as well or perhaps some leaps. The insiders are pretty easy to predict, they wanna cause a price pump to $20+ cuz they want to cash out and they believe they can do it hence the aggressiveness on price hikes cuz last price hike the stock pumped abt 25% so they thought “let’s do it again”, a price hike also offset so much losses in Q3 despite only being there for a fraction of the quarter (September only, not even a full month) so a second price hike is HUGE going forward cuz the impact of the first hasn’t even been fully realized",0.9939

"ASTR - Future wars (micro DD) - ASTR makes small rockets that can deploy with little notice from a standard container from nearly anywhere.

Satellites will be destroyed in large numbers in future wars given the proliferation of satellite killer missiles. Quick redeployment is vital for maintaning force capabilities (even if replacements are smaller with fewer features). Current satellite launches take months to prepare.

Also, the profile of their rockets and launch platforms effectively makes them ballistic missiles, if ever needed. Fitting in a standard container is a large bonus for flexible and hidden deployment.

ASTR is not explicitly a military firm, but their products fit perfectly for future wars with near peers. Militaries worldwide are likely eyeing what ASTR can offer with interest. Even if a major war never happens, countries prepare for them. Further, one of ASTR's mottos is 'Simple Scales' - their production processes will work well in wartime conditions.",0.3291

(And at any rate, robust social spending tends to  increase inflation.) 

That said, I know from experience that many people who could afford to be investing just have some mental block that stops them from doing so. A lot of my friends who are working or lower middle class just have this knee-jerk aversion to getting into the market even when they have money left over from a paycheck to be investing. I spend a lot of time trying to help them get over it and make better financial decisions, but sometimes it’s like pulling teeth, and I get frustrated and go on Reddit and post stuff like above.

"I looked up the dates of her husband’s trades, and they seem pretty late to me. She’s been in Congress for a very long time and has been disclosing for the whole time. So it’s pretty easy to track what they bought and when. 

Do you have an example of a particularly suspicious trade? For example, putting a large percentage of their net worth in a small cap stock that blew up shortly afterwards? Bonus points if they got their money from the government or via a policy position she took.

I get a kick out the meme the same as anyone, but if there was anything to it, I’d actually clone their trades instead of just chuckling. From what I’ve seen, a ton of the pre-GME people in this sub made the same trades as her husband around the same time. 

The only trade that seemed suspicious to me was the Amazon and Microsoft Pentagon deals, since she could have influenced them or known the outcome in advance. But their timing was suboptimal and they left a lot of money on the table. Their return was not much better than chance or what passive index investors experienced.",0.7985
"No. I was never claiming she nor her husband made suspicious trades. That was someone else. My only point was that large caps weren't necessarily as obvious as people like to claim -- tho, I can certainly agree, they were pretty damn obvious. Cheers.",0.743

All forward earnings will need to account for massive tax increases to personal incomes, corporate taxes, rate increases, inflation, and investor appetites towards risk.

Gold, silver, copper, financials will all be safe havens.

I’m sure you DCA longs will do just fine, but you can already start to see the capital flows into rock solid businesses like Costco. P/E expansion in Costco has grown from 35 to 50 in the matter of 6 months.

Stock markets get defensive too. They are going to put their money into businesses that can weather these issues.

Since the US issues it’s own fiat currency, debt literally does not matter. All that matters is inflation.

"The cost of servicing the debt matters, though. When we add to the debt load faster than we're able to inflate it away (as we have over the last 20 years), the increased cost of servicing debt forces interest rates to stay low. In the short term that's not such a big deal. In the long term it forces us to either allow inflation to run out of control for awhile to help balance things out, or else raise interest rates and raise taxes to offset the extra carrying costs on our debt. The former hurts the middle and working classes, while the latter slows the economy. 

It is quite false to claim that we can spend as much as we want and simply ignore the debt load. Government crises in Greece, Italy, and the USSR have taught us various forms of this lesson. It's more accurate to say that some debt is useful and necessary as a tool, but there's a line that is dangerous to cross. It's unfortunately unclear exactly where that line is.",-0.9118

"Sure. 

A fixed indexed annuity is an insurance product. It’s indexed to let’s say the s&p 500. You lock your money up fir a 7,20,14, or even 20 year period where you can take a penalty free ten percent withdraw every year. 

Indexing to the index gives you a participation rate, the longer it’s locked up the higher the rate is. So if you’re participation rate is 90, you get 90 percent of the growth of the index. Every year you lock in your gains, or dependent on the contract it could be two or three years you lock in your gains. 

Since these are an insurance product your principal is protected so the maximum drawdown is zero. Meaning you can’t lose. 

In an environment like today, with rates set to rise and bonds being incredibly bearish, they’re a fantastic product for risk averse people who don’t want to lose and don’t need full access to principal. Advisors are beginning to use them as a bond replacement for the traditional bond sleeve of a clients portfolio. 

Their aren’t fees, the only fee is what you’re letting the annuity company keep via the participation rate. Also, the annuity company pays the advisor from their rear e funds so the client literally never loses money. Over a 20 year period they CAGR on a lot of these is 5.8 percent. 

Hope that helps!",0.9536
"Thank you for your insightful commentary! If you aren't inclined to listen to her take on Modern Monetary Theory, there's always Robert Reich, Professor, former Secretary of Labor, and Co-founder of Inequality Media Civic Action:

""What’s really driving inflation? Corporate power.  
The biggest culprit for rising prices that’s not being talked about is the increasing economic concentration of the American economy in the hands of a relative few giant big corporations with the power to raise prices.  
If markets were competitive, companies would seek to keep their prices down in order to maintain customer loyalty and demand. When the prices of their supplies rose, they’d cut their profits before they raised prices to their customers, for fear that otherwise a competitor would grab those customers away.    
But strange enough, this isn’t happening. In fact, even in the face of supply constraints, corporations are raking in record profits. More than 80 percent of big (S&P 500) companies that have reported results this season have topped analysts’ earnings forecasts, according to Refinitiv.  
Obviously, supply constraints have not eroded these profits. Corporations are simply passing the added costs on to their customers. Many are raising their prices even further, and pocketing even more.    
How can this be? For a simple and obvious reason: Most don’t have to worry about competitors grabbing their customers away. They have so much market power they can relax and continue to rake in big money.  
The underlying structural problem isn’t that government is over-stimulating the economy. It’s that big corporations are under competitive.  
Corporations are using the excuse of inflation to raise prices and make fatter profits. The result is a transfer of wealth from consumers to corporate executives and major investors.  
This has nothing to do with inflation, folks. It has everything to do with the concentration of market power in a relatively few hands.  
It’s called “oligopoly,” meaning that two or three companies roughly coordinate their prices and output.  
One example of an oligopoly in household staples: Procter & Gamble and Kimberly Clark. In April, Procter & Gamble announced it would start charging more for everything from diapers to toilet paper, citing ""rising costs for raw materials, such as resin and pulp, and higher expenses to transport goods.""  
Baloney. P&G is raking in huge profits. In the quarter ending September 30, after some of its price increases went into effect, it reported a whopping 24.7% profit margin. Oh, and it spent $3 billion in the quarter buying its own stock.  
How can this be? Because P&G faces very little competition. According to a report released this month from the Roosevelt Institute, ""The lion’s share of the market for diapers,” for example, “is controlled by just two companies (P&G and Kimberly-Clark), limiting competition for cheaper options.""  
So it wasn’t exactly a coincidence that Kimberly-Clark announcedsimilar price increases at the same time as P&G. Both corporations are doing wonderfully well. But American consumers are paying more.   
Or consider another major consumer product oligopoly: PepsiCo (the parent company of Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Quaker, Tropicana, and other brands), and Coca Cola. In April, PepsiCo announced it was increasing prices, blaming ""higher costs for some ingredients, freight and labor.""   
Rubbish. The company recorded $3 billion in operating profits and increased its projections for the rest of the year, and expects to send $5.8 billion in dividends to shareholders in 2021.  
If PepsiCo faced tough competition it could never have gotten away with this. But it doesn’t. In fact, it appears to have colluded with its chief competitor, Coca-Cola – which, oddly, announced price increases at about the same time as PepsiCo, and has increased its profit margins to 28.9%.  
And on it goes around the entire consumer sector of the American economy.   
You can see a similar pattern in energy prices. Once it became clear that demand was growing, energy producers could have quickly ramped up production to create more supply. But they didn’t.   
Why not?  Industry experts say oil and gas companies (and their CEOs and major investors) saw bigger money in letting prices run higher before producing more supply.   
They can get away with this because big oil and gas producers don’t face much competition. They’re powerful oligopolies.   
Again, inflation isn’t driving most of these price increases. Corporate power is driving them.""

IV is far too high for your puts to be in the green tomorrow.

Remember that buying PUTS, writing CALLS and shorting are same same, but not same.

They are same in the fact that you need WISH to drop after earnings. But not same, because they each have their own risk/reward.

"China Pulled an 08 and I feel we are fucked - Let’s talk about something serious guys. I know this page is full of some legit senders and we like to throw it all on black. 

But what do we thinks going down with China? They defaulted 305 BILLION last month. And I believe 500 million or more of it was on American creditors. With a billion in our real estate here in the americas and another 3 billion around Europe? I think numbers could be a bit off but the default is a solid number that was calculated. 

This reeks of 08. And of course people claim that they will be bailed out. Except someone’s going to hold the bag like JP and Lehman did in 08.

So, we know China and the US aren’t the friendliest buddies. Or even Europe for that matter. What’s to stop them from pushing it to us? Who’s following this and what’s your plan or position? It’s easy to pull capital and “wait” but who knows how long that will be till the bottom drops and to what extent.",0.9153

"This is not actually like 08. In some ways, it rhymes if you think 08 was just a real estate crash, but it wasn't. What happened in 08 is that you had about 20-30 years of mortgages that were higher risk than they were being presented as, which coincided with a deregulatory regime that wasn't guarding any of the gates, a significant real wages decline without any serious attempt to combat it, and most significantly a banking and financial system that created a very, very topheavy house of cards that created a complex insurance-based hedging structure against the risk, resulting in so much of the financial system balancing debts on assets that were more toxic than they thought.

All of this combined to within a few years make what were supposed to be cash machines into toxic assets, and those cash machines were heavily represented through the entire global market... and when things came down, the insurance system basically collapsed the entire financial system because nobody took into account larger systemic failure in the hedge.

In this case, unlike American real estate, nobody should have been operating under the delusion than Chinese ghost cities were safe investments, and after 2008 there's more risk aversion in the financial systems.

While there's definitely similarities and the chance for contagion, it's not the same situation as 2008 and the degree of cross-investment for this situation just isn't there like it was in 2008. Also, China's a regulatory regime that has no problem intervening in their markets and they've already done some of the things that we did AFTER the 08 crash to fix the situation... they will let Evergrande et al fall, and while I'm not fan of the Chinese way of doing things, it's also different from 08.",-0.9782

The 08 real estate crash had more than a trillion dollars worth of bad loans wrapped up into homes the housing market won’t be what causes the next economic correction.  It’s the over leveraged retail investor pushing stock prices.  At some point in the next few months to years the leveraged retail investor will run out of money to invest to keep the prices at the inflated prices they currently are at and it will be a blood bath in the market and unfortunately the retail investors in the market with no other assets will be broke with tens of thousands or more in credit and loan debt with no assets to offset the debt.  Banks and financial institutions will be hit hard because there won’t be a house or something of similar value to take or foreclose on to offset the loses and the banks will be crippled and this economic correction will cause an even larger surge in inflation as the US government prints money to bail out the banks again and this will cause the USD to lose its position as the worlds reserve currency which will open the door for other currencies.,-0.8032

"It's a bit more complicated than that. Risky lending was a big part of it, as was the reduction in real wages... but that reduction in real wages eroded over an extended period of time. Part of the reason quants were quick to write that off was because of the assumption that money would come in and buy up properties and keep valuations afloat as a certain percentage of the loans defaulted. So the market can sustain a divergence for an extended period of time if there's liquidity.

That would have worked, to some extent, if not for the fact that a liquidity crisis did emerge. Debts can be serviced if capital is injected into the market, but there was a quadruple whammy where you had inflation, wage stagnation, the decline of higher pay jobs being slowly replaced by service industry lower pay work, and a lack of any intervention to increase Main Street liquidity.

Combined with the absurd high risk structures, all of those factors resulted in an inescapable systemic sucking event.

"I presume he's talking about the requirement to move to a subscription based payment plan rather than buying stuff up front. It used to be that we paid for a phone and entertainment system (i.e. Xbox or whatever) when we could afford it and then did whatever we wanted with them.

Now, companies are realizing that they can afford to charge more in total by giving it out in monthly payments in a subscription service that never ends. And they can offload the risk by handing them to finance companies (they just have to up their prices a bit to account for the lost profits).

So if everything moves to a subscription base - healthcare & insurance & mortgage already are, but more people are buying cars with longer (i.e. never-ending) loan periods, cell phones, entertainment services, productivity/work software, all of that stuff is moving that direction.

At that point, a big economic shock (like a recession) hits all companies hard at the same time. Nintendo can afford to just weather a bad year by the money they stocked up on for the last three years, but when they can't stockpile money (because their profit margins aren't big enough to do it), their reserves require monthly subscription owners that will have cancelled because they have to.

"Huh, it didn't make me subscribe. The TL;DR I guess is private CMBS issuance (privately-issued debt used for real-estate) ""rose to over $100 billion for the first nine months of this year, putting it on pace to surpass 2019’s record of $115 billion"".

The concerning bit is that conduit deals (safer, large-scale real-estate deals) ""have made up $22.6 billion or 22 percent of total private-label CMBS issuance ... down sharply from 2017 to 2020, when conduit deals averaged 46 percent of the market"". Instead, as ""conduit deals have slowed, commercial real estate collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, are on the upswing."" 

The article considers this concerning because ""compared to CMBS conduit loans with 10-year terms, CRE CLOs are often riskier mortgages, such as bridge or transitional loans, with a term of two to three years and options for one- to two-year extensions. CRE CLOs today are a revamped version of the collateralized debt obligations that became notorious for their role in the 2008 Financial Crisis.""

And ""the decline in conduits has widespread implications for the market — mainly, that fewer fixed-rate bonds are available in the private CMBS market. Only 29 percent of CMBS and CRE CLO issuance in 2021 was fixed-rate, down from more than half of the market previously.""

"I’m not saying it is immune from NY’s rent laws, but I am saying that these are irrelevant. It has more to do with the mortgage on the property than the laws of NY. I understand your point is that lessors are unwilling to drop the rent because their increase from last year can only be ten percent YoY, but that’s it’s not like all these commercial renters are going around demanding rent be cut in half. The problem is with the valuation of the property. Commercial property loans are based on the values it expects to get for rent. Can’t get that much in rent? Well, then your building isn’t worth as much as you said it was and that means it’s a shit loan. Can’t have that. 

Those months the space is empty, the lender tacks those mortgage payments to the back side of the loan. The property still valued at a million bucks because the rent hasn’t changed, the note is still in good standing for the time being and the lessor now has another month to find a tenant. 

*Of course the rent has changed, now the rent is $0!* No it isn’t, because you don’t have a signed lease agreement with $0 as the rent price. The rent is still $1,000 a month. 

Why not just drop the rent? Well, the valuation of the property is based on rent price. So if you drop the rent, you have to devalue the property. The loan on the property has been rolled into a CMBS and now you have to get a majority vote from folks who have stake in the CMBS to devalue the property. That’s a difficult task.

"Lol oops, that reply was meant for someone else who was crying about ""CcP eViL"" and no other argument dunno how my reply ended up here xd 

But the Evergrande is definitely involved both at higher levels of the CPC but also at the lower levels. What most foreigners don't seem to realize is roughly 1 in 15 people are members of the CPC and if you include former members it's roughly 1:7. There are also multiple parties within the party and some of the upper levels are clearly going to... ""Retire"" into the woods after this. The Evergrande however will probably be partially bailed out at best and only the sectors where the assets are within 100% state control. Foreign investors will definitely hold the bag on this.",0.9682
"Don't you think the opposite would be better for competition and the economy though? Walmart historically had the tactic of moving into a town, flexing it's billion dollar bank account to drop prices and operate at a loss until it put local competition out of business, then raising prices. A small local business can't survive one bad year or or a economic recession that's not their fault but the McDonald's and Taco Bells of world can basically never fail",0.2509

So IMO this stock has some legs to run up to. Could it be $100+? No one knows, but upside to have stock price go up…yes. Earnings have been factor into stock price most likely IMO.",0.705

Wish introduced the **Wish Standards** program to incentivize quality products and other positive behaviors from its merchants. The new program, which was announced at Wish’s Global Merchant Summit, **measures merchants against a defined set of criteria spanning product quality, shipping experience, customer reviews, refund rates and compliance with Wish policies.**

  
Merchants who qualify for the program will benefit from commission discounts, expedited payment terms and greater exposure for their products within the app. They will also carry a ‘Premier Merchant Badge’ that will feature prominently across their product listings and merchant store.",0.9666

"The Avatar Index AKA James Cameron and the Box Office Boogaloo AKA The Inflation Game - After seeing the latest inflation numbers, and seeing [this chart](https://i.redd.it/qd0zhlor7ny71.jpg) that is currently on the front page. I wanted to add some further DD that comes from a different angle. 

That we apes are not the only ones who see the coming shit storm and are looking to make a tidy profit. 

When *James Cameron's Avatar* came out in 2009 it became the highest grossing film ever making **$2.8 Billion dollars**. It did this largely by being an amazing theatre experience that everyone wanted to see, but it also had the wind at its back in terms of economic conditions. The dollar was weak, exchange rates were favorable, and we were only just limping out of the crash of 08/09. 

Why is this relevant? Because if you look at the chart above, 14 months after that period in '08 when the crash started, Avatar came out. Can you guess what happens in 14 months from now? **Avatar 2 comes out.**

Am I saying James Cameron is best friends with Michael Burry? No. Am I saying that he can predict market crashes? Maybe. Am I saying this is one big strange coincidence that they just so happen to line up exactly as back in '08? Yes. Yes I am. 

**TL;DR** Avatar came out after the last big crash, made bank. Avatar 2 set to come out in a year = next big crash come, makes bank again.",0.2617

"Debt Ceiling deadline Dec. 3 - I understand that ignorance is bliss and our politicians will play chicken in order to look strong. However the deadline to raise the debt Ceiling is fast approaching and no one is talking about it. Won't this have HUGE effects on the market? Of course it will! America could in fact default on it's debt for the first time in history, America's credit rating could fall yet again interest rates and inflation could skyrocket all in less than 10 weeks.

As of right now I am working to free up as much capital as possible as I think this will cause the market to fall as we inevitably get closer and hopefully make a beautiful set up to buy some company's at a discount. 

Now as I am just as retarded as the next window licker I'm curious what others think about what may happen and if there are better strategies to make money on the incompetence of our leaders and the possibility of financial collapse.",0.9287

I work in banking and we've gone through a few simulation models (iirc, it was markov-chain monte carlo based) on how degradation in other economies outside of the US may influence our domestic market.

Instead of presenting everything in black/white like some retards trying to pump/dump, here are a few of my thoughts + take everything I say with a grain of salt.

- A lot has to go wrong not only in China, but multiple other economies at once in order for the US to be affected significantly. Simulation models account for exposure, obviously.

- The comment above is independent of domestic monetary / fiscal policy

- No one has a crystal ball as to what may happen with China in the near future and if they pretend like they do, they're talking out of their ass

- Keep in mind that bank models are extremely deficient in some respects. Coming from grad school where I like to cross validate models using k-fold cross validation with at least k=5, banks don't really do this shit for some of their models (depends on LOB, objective, etc)

- The models we were shown were pre-pandemic but I still think some of their assertions hold true

- I just don't want some fucking retard going HEE HEE HEE CHINA DEFAULT US IS FUKT. Maybe you're right but eat my hairy asshole

- There are plenty of people here that are wayyyy smarter than me. I have 0 clue where to park my investments right now so I'd appreciate some advice + the logic behind your advice. I'm mostly sitting on cash but I put a small % of my portfolio into REITs. Gib advice ty men

** Edit. Cool, the Fed's saying the same shit as what I wrote above. They categorized the Evergrande debacle as ""very particular"" to China with ""some risk"" domestically due to possible global contagion. Source: https://www.ft.com/content/fcfe51bc-b7f9-4939-88f7-2f49892440f7",-0.9508

Now according to NYT and Bloomberg, they \*have\* made their bond payments (confirmed by holders of 2 of the 3 bonds). As for declaring default/bankruptcy? Nope.

yesterday,' says DMSA senior analyst Dr. Marco Metzler"" - probably can be interpreted as ""the Fed also thinks Evergrande's going bankrupt"", if I'm making the right attribution.

TL;DR This means abso-fucking-lutely nothing. This is some independent analyst saying the sky is falling and people are taking it as fact despite no major financial reporting org saying jack sht. If Evergrande defaulted the major banks would've had no qualms of throwing them under the bus. Just like 5 seconds of even reading the OP's link and you can tell it's just garbled FUD. ""Oh hur dur according to time zones Chinese banks should be closing and we haven't heard anything from banks about the bond payments so obviously Evergrande defaulted."" That's LITERALLY their thesis. Oh and that the default of Evergrande will create some apocalyptic ""Great Reset"" event lol you got to be kidding me. This is like falling for some tumblr fanfiction and believing it to be canon.

"A major issue with a bailout is that it would have to be done very quietly.  There is already civil unrest brewing over the loss of large down payments paid by loyal CCP citizens.  So propping the company up without addressing the public concern is a bad look for a government which styles itself the father of ""the people"".  It'd be a really hard sell...not that they wouldn't just unleash tanks on the resulting riots, but it's just a bad look.  Additionally it was policies instituted by the CCP that resulted in Evergrande being in this position since real estate companies now have to come into compliance with debt loads after decades of creating high leverage.  Now they can't borrow to stave off the wolves. 

If anything this seems to be a play by Xi to turn real estate development into a government held entity.  When Evergrande starts to go over the edge they can swoop in a buy the company and then it will be state backed and state controlled.",-0.7577

"> and whether or not they'll let Evergrande die or bailout + continue domestic payments while giving the middle finger to international investors

"Took about a year between when they folded their subprime shop and bankruptcy. It’s been about a year since China instituted the Three Red Line policy which stymied EG’s access to new leverage and resulted in the present liquidity crunch. The market dynamics are a bit different here as the Chinese property sector is still *technically* in growth mode and the deleveraging is somewhat artificial and preemptive. However, it’s still gonna drag the Chinese property sector and any foreign investments therein, and will put sell pressure on foreign markets that Chinese financiers have been investing in.

">U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990, cementing high inflation as a hallmark of the pandemic recovery and eroding spending power even as wages surge.

>The consumer price index increased 6.2% from October 2020, according to Labor Department data released Wednesday. The CPI rose 0.9% from September, the largest advance in four months. Both advances exceeded all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

>Higher prices for energy, shelter, food and vehicles fueled the supercharged reading and indicated inflation is broadening out beyond categories associated with reopening.

>Stock futures dropped after the report, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose and the dollar strengthened.

>Against a backdrop of solid demand, businesses have been steadily raising prices for consumer goods and services at the same time supply chain bottlenecks and a shortage of qualified workers drive up costs.

>**Fed Pressure**

>The pickup suggests higher inflation will be longer-lasting than previously thought, putting pressure on Federal Reserve officials to end near-zero interest rates sooner than expected and potentially to quicken the pace of the bond-buying taper announced last week.

>The data also threaten to exacerbate political challenges for President Joe Biden and Democrats as they seek to pass a nearly $2 trillion tax-and-spending package and defend razor-thin congressional majorities in next year’s midterm elections.

>A report on Tuesday showed prices paid to U.S. producers also accelerated last month, largely due to higher goods costs, and adding to concerns about persistent price pressures across the globe. 

>In China, inflation at the factory level last month increased by the most in 26 years, while consumer prices in Brazil sped up by more than forecast.

>Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core inflation rose 0.6% from the prior month and 4.2% from a year earlier. The annual increase was the largest since 1991.

>Shelter costs -- which are considered to be a more structural component of the CPI and make up about a third of the overall index -- rose 0.5% in October, the most in four months as higher rents and home prices feed into the data. The cost of hotel stays increased.

>Prices for new cars rose 1.4% last month as a global shortage of semiconductors continues to limit inventories and drive up costs. Used-vehicle prices jumped 2.5%.

>Americans are also facing higher costs for basic necessities:
*Food up 5.3% from year ago, most since January 2009
*Gasoline rose 6.1% from September, biggest gain since March
*Electricity costs jumped 1.8%, largest monthly increase since 2014
*Fuel oil advanced 12.3% from prior month, most since 2007

>**Through the Company Lens**

>“We haven’t seen, I’ll say, any more resistance to our price increases than we’ve seen historically.” -- McDonald’s Corp. CFO Kevin Ozan, Oct. 27 earnings call

>“Looking at Q4, we expect our selling price actions to continue to gain traction, as we work to mitigate the raw material and logistics inflationary pressures we have experienced throughout the year.” -- 3M Co. CFO Monish Patolawala, Oct. 26 earnings call

>“We feel very comfortable that any inflation that is affecting our margin today, we have the ability to offset it.” -- Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CFO John Hartung, Oct. 21 earnings call

>“We have now announced pricing in nine out of ten categories, so very broad based.” -- Procter & Gamble Co. CFO Andre Schulten, Oct. 19 earnings call

>While most CPI categories rose, the cost of airfares declined for a fourth month and apparel prices were unchanged.

>Wages have strengthened markedly in recent months -- with some measures rising by the most on record -- but higher consumer prices are eroding Americans’ buying power.

"The week ahead (Semis and CyberSecurity) - My previous post discussing AMAT, SNPS, PANW, CRWD and ZS lays out a set of observations and a thesis I won’t repeat here.

And thus far, what I have seen has fallen in line with that post. You can see AMAT and SNPS running together price-wise, and, based on today’s premarket, tech will take a hit today. I was not, before today, inclined to treat today as a buying opportunity before some heavyweights I like report (NVDA, AMAT). That’s because I expect retail earnings and guidance to be a drag on markets next week.

But I could be wrong on that front if disappointing tape in retail drives people back into growth stocks. Keep an eye out… positions next week will probably include SNPS (not too heavy because it seems to be low volume) and CRWD.",-0.4588

I started a business distributing food products to schools nationally. We own some brands others we don't. It is the worst environment I've ever seen across the board.  
  
Labor is the biggest issue. There aren't enough food workers to run the food service programs. I've seen 2 employees feeding thousands of kids when there were 20 there pre pandemic. This means their buying habits have changed to prepackaged goods sometimes doubling their food cost.  
  
The manufacturers can't keep up with the shift in demand as they are shortstaffed as well.  
  
Freight has gone up 3-4x since pandemic domestically because their aren't enough truck drivers. One of my competitors canceled 78 contracts to provide them food at the start of the school year. It is chaos.  
  
Their aren't enough truck drivers to move things in a timely manner. I'm waiting 2 months at times for things at the port. My price per container has gone from $4400 pre pandemic to $27,500! A case of fruit has gone up 250%!

"Not really all that surprising. Most of it's in the same sectors where the supply chain is currently shifting or constrained, primarily fuel costs. Fuel costs always spike in the winter, so the fact that there's some excess pressure here isn't much of a surprise. Pre-GDP factors also point to an increase in economic activity since the delta variant wave started to decline, so we should see that increase as well. What's going to be interesting is if a new COVID wave reduces economic activity, which could cause the first actual indication of stagflation in the data, but that should be short-lived unless there's some kind of liquidity crunch and right now that's not in the data. But at least that would be an actual datapoint for the stagflation hawks, unlike all of the other points they're calling stagflation that aren't. LOL

It's still an issue... whenever I talk about this people act like I'm saying it's not an issue. I'm watching the real wage divergence very closely.

The thing that is making me not freak out is that looking 6 months out, I see competing anti-pressures. Within the next 6 months, the winter fuel pressure will be alleviated and OPEC+ et al will realize they're leaving money on the table by not upping production and operating at volume. What's happening now is that energy producers have realized that they can play out the shift from the energy supply chain changes that happened during the pandemic for advancing profit, which is not a 1970s style situation. In other words, the chief cause of this inflation will eventually even out.

Other pressures will start to alleviate as manufacturing comes online in this country which is already happening. Labor shortages will begin to abate as demand evens out.

You can't just look at the number right now when projecting impact and action, you have to think further out because everything macro is at a larger scope, and larger scopes operate on larger time scopes.",0.9273

On the other hand, when I was in college in the 1970s, tuition to Texas schools was fixed at $50/semester-hour for a decade while I lollygagged my way through in 6 years for a 4 year degree. The legislature finally got around to increasing tuition in 1984. So from the time I started in 1975 to the time I graduated in 1981, the tuition effectively dropped from $50/sh to $29/sh.

Best thing to own in inflationary times is real property. Suppose your household is bringing in $10,000/month, and you buy a house for $3,000/month. In five years of 6% inflation, even if you don't get a raise and you only get cost of living increases, you'll be bringing in $13,300/month, and your payment stays the same.

How so? Generally inflation is advantageous to people with asset-backed-debt since it lowers the actual debt in real terms while increasing the value of the asset.,0.5423
"Sure. When the government wants to borrow money they sell treasury bonds. The yields are the returns on those bonds. If inflation spikes too high the yields become less attractive (the return can’t keep up with inflation) so the treasury needs to increase the yield else they can’t borrow money (because no one will buy the bonds at such a low rate of return so they up the rate of return “yield”). So an increasing yield is an indicator that the market isn’t interested in the bonds at current yields due to the low rate of return amid inflation. 

The reason the yields have been artificially low for so long is the Federal Reserve has been increasing artificial demand through buying Treasuries in secondary markets (Quantitative Easing). So the yields have been artificially kept below 2% for a while now which incentivized folks to invest instead in the markets. Essentially the Fed bought a large supply of treasury bonds in the secondary market which forced more to buy from the Treasury and thereby artificially increased demand and kept the yields low. So if the yields spike too high IN SPITE OF QE and Fed purchases, it’s a very bad day indeed. It means QE is failing and the government will need to pay a lot more to borrow money.",-0.7496

So those ""record highs"" you think were so great?  Yeah no, they were horrible moves.  They are WHY WE HAVE RAMPANT INFLATION now, you ignorant fool.  

So tell me: *What happens when an economy is at full employment and a leader implements expansionary monetary policy*?  

I'll tell you.

**If you use expansionary monetary policy while already at full employment (which Trump did to a massive degree), then you push the entire country into an inflationary gap**.  You know what a ""pump and dump"" is?  Well what Trump did was like a pump and dump for the entire god damn economy.  

However...

**Then, Covid hit and we GENUINELY needed expansionary monetary policy because employment crashed.  So now we're now dropping massive amounts of money into the economy AGAIN**.

GUESS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU DO THAT, IDIOT...

*Inflation*.

Massive, massive amounts of inflation.

So in summation, your piece of shit traitor Trump completely screwed this country over with his tax breaks to millionaires, and that mistake was compounded by the Pandemic that he ALSO completely bungled, and now we have horrible rates of inflation.  And there is almost NOTHING that can be done that won't be painful as heck.

All because of ignorant idiots like you voting for a monster.

...

On a side note, 1. Trump didn't build a strong economy.  He inherited it.  Then he fucking crashed it into a wall like an idiot.

...

Inflation is a problem, so I named the specific monetary policy actions of the Trump administration that DID cause inflation, and now we are stuck with the consequences his awful decisions..  Expansionist monetary policy while already at full employment DOES cause an economy to swing into an inflationary gap.  *That's a fact*.  

And it's a fact that is true no matter who the boss is.

So, did the Trump administration go all-in on expansionary monetary policy during his ENTIRE Presidency? At a time when we were at or near to full employment and he SHOULD have been using contractionary monetary policy??

**YUP! And YUP!**

So far I have recapped some of Trump's decisions and their effects...**WOW SO UNHINGED, BRAH!!!**

Anyway...

Well guess what all that spending did, you asshole?  **it pushed this country into a fucking INFLATIONARY GAP**.  So every time one of you bring up Trump's economy prior to Covid like it was a booming success, *you're dead wrong, dickhead*.

**It was nothing bit this country absolutely EXPLODING it's debt to unprecedented levels at a time when it should have been doing the polar opposite**.

And the results of that disgustingly bad behavior was...

**I N F L A T I O N**.

That's a fact, whether you like it or not, *you little bitch*.

Trump SHOULD have been using contractionary monetary policy FROM DAY ONE. Because from day one Trump was handed a strong economy on a silver platter, **AND HE COMPLETELY FUCKED IT UP!**

Just like the last conservative President did.  W. Bush walked into a great economy, and he left with the country in shambles.  Trump walked into a great economy, and he left with the economy in shambles.  Except this time with the added bonus of an attack on our capital by traitors.

Oh, and since it takes about two years after a policy change **under normal circumstances** to see the affects of the decision on the economy, you only got to start seeing the horrible consequences of your own disgusting representative not too long ago.

Which was just enough time for you to have studied economics, statistics, and recent history.  Except you never did, so you're still the same dumb fuck piece of shit you were before, *except a little fatter*.

Citation needed. The cost of healthcare in the US is not related to supply and demand in the slightest, people don't generally get to choose what hospital they're carted off to in a medical emergency and there are plenty of doctors when the country isn't in the middle of the worst pandemic since 1917. This means the hospital can charge literally whatever they want for the cost of their care and your insurance company is obligated to pay it, and if you don't have insurance too bad. Insurance companies, because they are profit driven enterprises, also try to pass on the cost to the customer in whatever way they can get away with, meaning if you pay for a pretty good plan you still may end up having to pay a couple grand in medical fees, or you may not even be covered at all because the hospital you were taken to in a critical health emergency wasn't in your provider's network. This is the reason the US pays more for medical care than every other nation in the world on average, because medical costs are just simply insanely inflated relative to what they actually are. In a public system, insurance companies don't get to pass on healthcare costs to the consumer, and theoretically the government gets to set the price they will pay the hospital because well, they're the government, meaning the hospital can't openly gouge as easily. You sound like you're in the middle of an econ 101 class, so I'll remind you that the models discussed are simply models that are *generally* accurate, they can't account for every variable within every system.",0.8481

It's bad even when you don't have the most corrupt administration in history running the USG as we did these previous 4 years.

"I don't know, I think a Latin American union does make sense in the long run. We wouldn't have a single president of course, just like the EU, and we wouldn't have power centralized. Most countries would remain somewhat independent, but things like currency, trade and commerce could be very much unified and all economies would grow stronger. It could very well be a symbiotic relationship between different countries. Easier access to raw materials for some, better healthcare and opportunities, better regulation for others. If all of Latin America had some unified legislation and currency (like the European Union) it's very unlikely that it would get to Venezuela levels of failure. Larger countries tend to be a lot more covered and diversified than smaller ones like Venezuela, that just can't face crises like these.

Also, the measure to make sure the union doesn't immediately destroy wealthier countries is to have certain requirements to join (like the EU), so for instance a country like Venezuela, Nicaragua or Argentina wouldn't be able to join until they reduce their inflation, poverty rates, etc. So probably in several decades.

Meanwhile, countries like Chile, Colombia, Uruguay, Ecuador, Peru, Panama, Costa Rica, Mexico or even Cuba eventually, could probably considering their annual inflation rates, poverty rates, etc. They'd meet the requirements. The advantage of things like these is that the same union gets to decide the requirements in order to shape it however they like. They have to be strict, though, and each country has to give away some of their stuff. But that's fine.

I'm Colombian. To be honest I'd be fine with our government not having certain choices on some company rights, trading and currency, and instead debating those choices globally with people from Chile, Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Brazil, etc.

Sure, each country has their own rights as sovereign states, we wouldn't become a single country (at least not in the near future), but I think it could be quite beneficial.

Africa should enter into a currency bloc too, but that's an even harder sell given the dysfunction and powerful interests like the mining companies that are exploiting them.

As to Latin America, a common currency would provide a lot of stability, and standardized trading rules and such would provide the stability to get investment in projects like infrastructure and industry, a rail system connecting them for passenger and freight and highways for starters, then they could start value added manufacturing from all the metals and fuels they extract as opposed to having to sell them to corporations.  Collectively they have about every natural resource just as the US, Russia, and China do, and there is no reason they couldn't be an economic powerhouse with stable economies if they put on a United Front on a few issues.

Of course how do you deal with military coups and dictators I don't know, Venezuela for instance, it is crucial to such a bloc with all of the oil, or most of it anyway and they politically are a basket case.

> There were many ways of measuring, and even defining, money, which often gave conflicting answers about whether the printing presses should be accelerated or slowed. Moreover, a perversity that came to be known as Goodhart’s Law showed that when central bankers measured money in a particular way and set this as a target, financial markets would quickly hoard or dump that kind of money, thereby guaranteeing the breakdown of whatever relationship had previously existed between this definition of money and inflation.

> The claim that printing money always creates inflation is wrong as a matter of simple logic. What Friedman actually found in his research was that a burst of rapid monetary growth always precedes high inflation. This in no way implies the converse: that a period of high inflation always follows a burst of monetary growth. To confuse a proposition with its converse is the most elementary of logical errors: For example, all crows are black birds, therefore any black bird is a crow. This fallacy, despite its obvious absurdity, appears ubiquitously in politics as a rhetorical trick. For example: “Shooting deaths are always and everywhere the responsibility of someone with a gun. Therefore, anyone with a gun is always and everywhere responsible for a shooting death.”

> This question leads to the second fallacy in the precrisis dogmatic interpretation of Friedman’s maxim. Although monetary growth is in some sense a necessary condition for rapid inflation, the precise correlation between money and inflation has never been even roughly quantified because money can be defined in so many ways in a modern capitalist economy and the influence on inflation of any of these ways of measuring the money supply can be observed only with “long and variable lags.”

"> are the people that were able to protect their wealth now able to buy up everything from the people that didn't?

Not sure what you mean by this. It isn't like there was a housing crash and now all the rich bought the houses and are renting them. The biggest issue is the Bolivar is pretty much useless. If you ""protected your wealth"" it meant you either a) switched to a foreign currency or b) have a lot of assets that made you self sufficient in a way.

The small amount you actually have to pay is way lower than the amount you'd be burning in taxes in Europe and you actually get care when you need it.

Your problem is that you're thinking way too shortsighted on this. Inflation invariably HAS to end with deflation. The higher the market goes on the backs of the FED purchases of MBS and Treasury products and 0 FED fund rates the more it has to fall during the deflationary period. Right now PAIN is accumulating at record rates and the dumb ass fucking FED thinks they can hold it all back. But all they're doing is pushing that boulder of PAIN farther up the hill.

I think they have over valued their IPO and they could see the shares drop by as much as 20%. Full disclosure, I've reserved a R1T for next year and hope to drive one soon, but this IPO seems like the perfectly wrong time as we red across the board pre-market. 

As a fan of the company and hopeful future customer, I was hopeful for this IPO, but I'm keeping my money on the sideline at least for a few weeks.

"I don’t think Amazon can just pull out anytime whenever they want. Only under certain circumstances are they allowed to. Based on what I read, it’s not officially a 4 year contract but it sounds like one. Amazon has to essentially buy at least 10,000 of Rivians suv if failed to do so then Amazon has to reimburse what they owe. After the “4 year contract” then Amazon has the right to refuse anymore vehicle from Rivian.

Again, only under certain circumstances can Amazon pull out within the 4 years. I would assume if Rivian fails to meet expectations or their vehicles are a bust then that’s when Amazon would pull out. I’m sure Amazon wants this company to succeed otherwise why would they back it up? Why would they own about almost 20% of Rivian? Why would they already have 100,000 vehicles ready to be use under them? They certainly see something out of Rivian. I certainly can argue that it doesn’t matter who backs you up, if you’re product is crap then you’re really worth nothing. We shall see what happens I’m personally really excited to see what’s to come. Definitely gonna throw some money at it.",0.9757
They do have a target sell of 100k vehicles to Amazon alone which should equate to about $1b in sales but it remains to be seen how that will net out and the Rivian ceo is projecting $1b losses for costs…I personally will let the dust settle on this one for a week or two.

Neither of the first two are affordable for the majority of buyers and may be priced too high to qualify for federal tax credits, and the third has to compete solely on cost.

Yup. They invested $500mill originally when Rivian first started. So a $10b return without needed to really do anything worked out real well in their favor lol .,0.765

Who?  Rivian is using 21700 cells from Samsung SDI.  Those are commodity items, and there hasn't been any reputable news regarding special chemistry or otherwise for Rivian as a customer.  Rivian's efficiency numbers also appear to indicate there is nothing special going on with the cells.",0.7845

In the US.  And maybe that's okay for Rivian's strategy.

The >$70k pickups being sold right now are full size.  The Rivian is an odd-ish midsize truck platform.  I have no doubt Rivian will be supply constrained for the near future.  I just don't see people cross shopping current ICE trucks with the R1T.",-0.4939

Those >$70k trucks are generally SuperDutys and similar.

I think Rivian is building a very capable EV truck, but I don't think they are competitive on capability and price with existing ICE vehicles.  That is OKAY.  I just wouldn't use the size of the existing truck market as validation for Rivian's potential.  Rivian appears to be targeting a different customer pool.",0.6538

"(11/10) Wednesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers & News - #Good morning traders and investors of the r/wallstreetbets sub! Welcome to Wednesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers & news on this Wednesday, November 10th, 2021-

*****

# [Stock futures are lower ahead of key inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. equity futures nudged lower early Wednesday as investors await key data that will indicate how much rising price pressures are accelerating.
*****
> Dow Jones Industrial Average futures shed about 60 points. S&P 500 futures dipped 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.6%.
*****
> Investors are holding their breath for the latest consumer price index reading, which the Labor Department will report Wednesday before the bell. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.6% increase, or a year-over-year gain of 5.9%, which would be the most in 30 years. They expect core CPI, which excludes food and energy, to have risen 0.4%, or 4.3% year-over-year.
*****
> With Thursday a government holiday due to the Veterans Day observance, the department also will release its weekly jobless claims count a day earlier than usual. The Dow Jones estimate is for 265,000 first-time filings for unemployment insurance, which would mark a fresh pandemic-era low.
*****
> In regular trading Tuesday, the Dow lost about 0.3% to close at 36,319.98. The S&P 500 fell 0.4%, snapping an eight-day win streak, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.6%.
*****
> The sell-off in Tesla continued as the electric vehicle stock fell more than 1% in premarket trading Wednesday, a day after ending nearly 12% lower and more than 16% down on the week.
*****
> “The weakness in Tesla (which is largely technical, not fundamental) is also weighing on the consumer discretionary sector within the S&P 500 today, and the October PPI may also be doing so as business input prices continue to rise,” Goldman Sachs’ Jeff Currie said in a note Tuesday.
*****
> “The prospect of Covid transforming from pandemic to endemic, and the potential for supply chain congestion to moderate are all likely to continue to drive growth, albeit more slowly,” Currie added.
*****
> On Tuesday morning, the Labor Department reported a 0.6% increase in the October producer price index, which iwas in line with the Dow Jones consensus estimate. Wholesale prices jumped 8.6% in October from a year ago, however, the hottest annual pace on record in almost 11 years.
*****
> “Investor worries came to the fore again today,” Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company, told CNBC. “The inflation narrative is still out there and needs to be resolved. We think investors will see inflation abate in the coming months as the Fed remains accommodative, people come back into the workforce and consumers shift from buying goods to services… and we expect that will pull the market higher as we move toward the end of the year.”
*****
> Earnings season continues to be strong, with most of the S&P 500 companies who have already reported earnings beating estimates, according to FactSet. Disney, Affirm, Bumble and The Honest Company are all scheduled to report Wednesday after the bell.

"BRK.B - A serious market underperformer - Warren Buffett's Berkshire has been a market underperformer for the last few years.  Lots of people (including me) have said he lost his touch or his style of investing is no longer adequate for today's market.

Is this actually true though?

A few quick metrics...

Revenue has grown 10% over 2019FY
Net Income has grown 25% over 2019FY
Free Cash Flow has grown 30% over 2019FY

Even in 2020, FCF grew over 2019 - During Covid!

Price to Book @ 1.38

12 month FCF stands at $29 billion.  With the current risk free rate, this equates to about $1 trillion market value.  Add in cash and deduct long term debt, we are sitting at $1.1 trillion.

Why is this valued only at $650 billion when so many other equities are over or at value using FCF valuation? It also underperforms within it's industry.

I hold some BRK.B and was going to sell, but I may just consider buying more considering how undervalued I see it's stock price.",0.6744

Any know why/how BRK.A went up 50% in the one after hours?,0.0
The company makes money.  Lots and lots of money.  And they buy back shares.  Like 6.4b $ of them last quarter.  But nobody cares because a 90 year old man apparently aint as sexy as Elon.  F that.   Just buy this.   Hold.  Make 10-12% a year.   Drink beer.,0.3991
I bought BRK.B in June 20 when it was just above it’s all time lows. Underperformed my ass,-0.6486
Let’s ponder this a moment…he is one of the most experienced and patient humans that deal with stocks on this earth. He has just shy of $150billion on hand and everyone is talking about a giant market crash….this dudes about to average down when it hits the bottom. What good is his money if it’s just in the form of currency? It’s good to lower the cost of more assets which is what he’s gonna do once shit tanks. Look at what he owns and once it dips buy the competition because he would want to kill that competition once it’s more vulnerable.,-0.7269
"I agree. The stock is so cheap given how much cash it has and how much it produces. Mr. Buffett is a value investor who has seen it all and, right now, given the froth in the market, one of the the only stocks that is cheap is his own. So he buys it. But if/when there is a correction or worse, the company (with or without him) will deploy its cash to buy good stocks cheap. Look at how they have cleaned up in the past. During the financial crisis, Berkshire made a killing.",-0.9118

From my understanding they bought back some shares,0.296
People will use the stock market to clean money. ie somebody owes somebody 200k so person x places a limit sell at 600k (200 above market) and person y places a limit buy at 600k. Person x gets their trade executed and resells the shares thereafter for market @400. 200k profit. Loanshark now successfully cleaned his money.,0.875

An order executed for a reason and it’s not a coincidence. If anything you belong here because you clearly don’t understand how markets work",-0.5046
Why else would an order execute 50% above market. Please explain,0.3182
"Yes, I do think a retard bought at a high price. I may be talking to that retard right now.",-0.6249
"What comes to mind are stupid investors who buy the news instead of the rumour. 

You see all the time in penny stocks. It’s how we get rich off of people like you.",0.4019
🤣,0.0
I doubt you’re rich because you clearly don’t understand the fundamentals of how trades execute. You need a buyer and seller to both agree. Companies with market caps over 600B don’t just jump 50% ‘like penny stocks’ lmfao. A buyer and seller both agreed to buy and sell 3 shares at a 50% premium. No volume to explain said increase. Just 1 single trade. I actually think you might be retarded or are simply a retail investor with zero investment knowledge,0.9001
I know right lol,0.4215
It’s like you read a quarter of your homework and thought to yourself “I got this!”,0.3612

"What is the best time to buy an IPO? - I analyzed 1,000+ IPO's over the last two decades! Here are the results! -  Given the growing hype surrounding the [$65 Billion Rivian IPO](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/05/rivian-raises-ipo-price-range-and-could-now-be-worth-up-to-65-billion.html) \[1\], I felt this is the perfect time to follow up on my [first analysis on IPOs](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/). In the previous analysis, we realized that the majority of gains were made from the listing itself and those who invested on listing day gained a measly 1.3%. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/f4e0nywl7ry71.png?width=950&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c9bb06a416c3cdedcd34b3e91c6f43af1e97f8b)

In most cases, [less than 10% of the total IPO](https://money.usnews.com/investing/investing-101/articles/how-to-buy-ipo-stock-at-its-offer-price) is allocated to retail investors. Adding to this, a multitude of other factors such as your brokerage account, account balance, the historical trading pattern will all contribute to whether you get the IPO shares or not in the end \[2\].

Given that the chances of you making it into the IPO allotment are bleak, what I wanted to analyze is, if we miss the IPO bus,

**What is the best time to buy into a recently IPO’d stock?**

Should it be on the listing day itself or should you wait a day, week, or even a month for all the hype surrounding the IPO to die down and the stock to come back to its “real” valuation \[3\]?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/n5wmym9n7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=a3106183b0670cb5c790d5034bf7ee76a4ca194b)

**Data**

I have leveraged the same data source (iposcoop.com) that I used last time. They have documented almost all the IPOs from 2000. But for this analysis, I also needed stock price-related information for periods long after the stock had been listed in the market.

The stock price information was obtained using Yahoo Finance. After all the quality checks, we are left with 1,063 IPOs from 2000-2020. All the data used in the analysis has been shared through a Google sheet at the end.

 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/9skwwgan7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=9789e067c476b12b7b962d587c002320623c388b)

**Analysis**

Since the idea is to find the best time to invest in an IPO, we have to compare the returns for multiple time periods. I calculated the one month and one year returns in case you had invested on the day of the IPO as well as if you had invested in the stock after

1. One day
2. One week
3. One month

The returns are then compared against each other to find the optimal time to invest in the stock after it has IPO’d. The returns were finally benchmarked against SPY to see if it makes sense to put in all these efforts - only to maybe underperform the market!

https://preview.redd.it/w2qnh2an7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e659778bbe8aaf8893f5d6f2ea21288ef4b7a71

 **Results** 

[ All calculations are done using the adjusted closing price  ](https://preview.redd.it/vknekrzo7ry71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=7fe4c5b99687e881d342df706a16fcd0ac0f255f)

Surprisingly, the gains you would have made from the IPOs are inversely proportional to the amount of time you waited for your investment. On average **the most amount of return is obtained by someone who invested on the day of the IPO itself**. The more amount of time you wait for your investment, the lesser your return is!

But what if you are not interested in the short-term returns? What if you are a buy-and-hold type of investor?

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/uazvvt0q7ry71.png?width=730&format=png&auto=webp&s=38ff88f577596544308b493f072d66240507cc7d)

If you are a long-term investor, **you would be better off buying the IPO after waiting for a week**, as it generated the most amount of return. But what is interesting is that waiting a week for the hype to die down would only increase your return by 9%. Waiting any further would only ***decrease your overall return.***

So if you are planning on buying into an IPO but did not get an allocation at the listing price, you can wait a week so as to see how it performs in the market, avoid any large swings that the first week might cause, and still come out on top over the long run!

Now, let’s compare the performance of IPO stocks against SPY. After all, even though you are getting a good return on your investment, if it does not beat the market, you would have been better off just investing it in SPY rather than doing all this research on IPOs.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/ehviuevq7ry71.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=880c9f18392da5832a239819b38cd6dc04893875)

IPOs’ returns on average ***beat the market*** over the last two decades. The trends are similar to the ones observed earlier with the delta over the market return depending on how much time you waited before investing into the IPO and generating the highest amount of delta by waiting one week from the day of the IPO.

Now it would be amiss not to discuss the inherent risks associated with investing in an IPO. Out of the 1,063 IPO’s in our analysis, only 62% of them gained in value and only a measly 29% of the IPOs beat the market over the long run. The outperformance over the market is coming due to a few outliers (Tesla - 25,000%+, Shopify - 5800%+, etc.) If you miss out on the top 1% of successful IPOs, your returns would be much lesser than the market. 

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/5np1iman7ry71.png?width=1728&format=png&auto=webp&s=ed89afca9e90fdc3288899fcab548a8155beecdc)

**Limitations**

The above analysis comes with some limitations that you should be aware of before trying to replicate the strategy

1. The number of IPOs in the analysis is approximately 1/3rd of the total IPOs which occurred during 2000-2020 \[4\]. I don’t think this is a major concern since our sample of 1000+ stocks would be much more than enough to give statistical significance to our analysis.
2. Another limitation is that the delta that you are observing here might just be due to the additional risk that you are taking by buying into lesser-known/small-cap companies. The risk-adjusted return might give a different result.
3. Continuing from the above point, we are currently in a massive bull run with ATH being broken every week. So the additional risk you are taking will be well rewarded but the outcome might look different if we do the same analysis in the middle of a bear market.

**Conclusion**

Buying into an IPO is an exciting prospect. Our analysis proves that even if you miss out on getting the IPO allocation, it’s still possible to beat the market by investing after the stock is listed on the market.

As I [explained in my last post on IP](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny6wpp/i_analyzed_3600_ipos_over_the_past_two_decades_to/)O, investment banks are incentivized to slightly underprice while listing (unless it’s a really popular company) so that the IPO issue is 100% subscribed (their fees are dependent on a successful IPO) \[5\].

Whatever the case may be, if you are planning on holding on to the IPO only for a short period of time, you can maximize your returns by investing in the IPO as soon as it’s listed whereas if you are a long term investor who is planning to hold on to the stock for a very long time, its better to wait a week or so for the stock price to settle before making your move!

Until next week…

**Footnotes**

\[1\] The company has [only built and delivered 56](https://insideevs.com/news/542908/rivian-production-numbers-first-month/) vehicles as of Oct21. If Rivian IPO’d at $65 Billion, it means that each vehicle it delivered added more than $1 Billion in value to its shareholders. A similarly valued Ford delivered 4.1 Million vehicles in 2020. Truly wild times we are living in!

\[2\] Brokerages tend to allocate IPO shares to their premium clients - [In the case of TD Ameritrade](https://www.tdameritrade.com/investment-products/IPOs.html), your account must have a value of at least $250,000 or have completed 30 trades in the last 3 months.

\[3\] Take the examples of Robinhood and Coinbase IPO. Robinhood tanked on listing day losing 8% only to rally almost 100% in the next one week before coming back down to near its IPO pricing. Coinbase also had a wild ride on listing day with the share price going as high as $429 before crashing back down to \~$310.

\[4\] The major limitation was the absence of financial data in Yahoo Finance for certain stocks.

\[5\] There are a lot of contradictory opinions regarding this with [some research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0275531918309280) showcasing that IPO’s are usually undervalued while [others argue](https://academic.oup.com/rfs/article-abstract/17/3/811/1612977?redirectedFrom=PDF) that IPOs are overvalued. I guess you can twist data however you want to tell your story.

"1. Really need to see the risk-adjusted returns. 

2. Much of the performance is due to a small number of outliers with huge returns you say? Then 1/3 of IPOs may in fact not be a large enough sample, especially because the outliers can only really go in one direction. That is, most an IPO can drop is 100%, but TSLA and SHOP have no limit on how high they can go, skewing results in one direction and making performance look better than it is.

3. It strikes me as unlikely that the average case is useful for understanding whether to buy any particular IPOs. IPOs are done more frequently when markets conditions are favorable, that is when stock prices are high or overinflated and credit is easy to get. That's why IPO frequency peaks soon before a crash (btw it has been hitting records in the past year, and don't forget the SPAC frenzy). This suggests a strong likelihood that many IPOs are companies that are trying to take advantage of buoyant capital-raising conditions but will ultimately prove to have weak performance in the medium-to-long term, or when market conditions are less buoyant. I.e., a large number of IPOs are just trying to cash-in on easy money and/or a highly speculative market. Knowing that means that you should not trust the average IPO result, and only look at every IPO individually to see if they really deserve your cash.",0.9381

"On the limitations, don't assume your sample size is enough to extrapolate. Why?

To put it simply, when we are talking about bell curved type of stuff 1k observations is enough. When we are talking about fat tailed stuff, forget about it, you need insane amount of observations to have statistical significance. Therefore, the only way to guarantee here the overperformance vs SPY is to buy all the IPOs, which is not worth it for retail investors probably. This is big fish strat. 2nd point, the overperformance for long holders if you buy 1 week later might not be statistical significant, due to what I explain above.",0.1313

Have you considered that the differences in the averages between the returns could be due to the natural ‘randomness’ in the market?

You said at one point in your post the difference was only 9%. Why only? Is that not significant in this context? Would 15% be significant? What is the line? Statistics can help us figure that out. They can also help prevent us from chasing differences that don’t really exist!

Why is it that these “vax or else” ultimatums aren’t being implemented until January? Isn’t the virus deadly now? Why the wait? Why why why why. Yet no answers to the millions of questions that we should be allowed to ask. Nope, if you question it then you’re part of the pandemic of the unvaxxed. Remember way back in 2020 when Joe Biden and Kamala Harris both said they would not take the “Trump” vaccine? Well, that’s their choice.  Oh wait….you mean the same one they’re trying to shove in my arm? It’s not that I don’t trust a vaccine in general. I don’t trust ANYONE making millions off a underdeveloped and rushed to market. I’m a human being not a Guinea pig. Again, I’ll repeat myself because the vaccine must block scientific research from your mind. Any c-19 vaccine, whatever the brand, is only 36 to 40% effective. Natural Immunity has 6 times that from a virus that has a 95% survival rate. That’s it. No more unbelievably bizarre responses necessary. It truly is bizarre.

I’m anti- people that are making a fortune from them acting as if they somehow have any authority to force these shots. GUIDELINES are not laws, RECOMMENDEDATIONS are not laws. MANDATES are not laws. The President of the United States does NOT have any Legislative Power to make any laws. He’s the Executive branch of government. Laws are made in the Legislative branch. Along with Judicial , the 3 are intentionally kept separate to keep government in check. That is called Separation of Powers. If we keep compromising and caving while giving an inch here and an inch there, they’ll undoubtedly start to get greedy and hungry for more power; more control. We don’t shred our constitution a little because it fits a certain narrative. The US Constitution is unambiguous in its meaning, purpose and power it has to keep us from being whatever government would choose is best for us.",0.9845

Right………sounds like a winner,-0.2263

"""Originally, the CPI was determined by comparing the price of a fixed basket of goods and services spanning two different periods. In this case, the CPI was a cost of goods index (COGI). However, over time, the U.S. Congress embraced the view that the CPI should reflect changes in the cost to maintain a constant standard of living. Consequently, the CPI has evolved into a cost of living index (COLI).  


Over the years, the methodology used to calculate the CPI has undergone numerous revisions. According to the BLS, the changes removed biases that caused the CPI to overstate the inflation rate. The new methodology takes into account changes in the quality of goods and substitution. Substitution, the change in purchases by consumers in response to price changes, changes the relative weighting of the goods in the basket.﻿ The overall result tends to be a lower CPI. However, critics view the methodological changes and the switch from a COGI to a COLI as a purposeful manipulation that allows the U.S. government to report a lower CPI.""",-0.6597

"""It is debatable whether any of the start-up EV automakers will ultimately be dominant over the long run, especially in a very competitive industry where the traditional automakers are also ramping up EV efforts. However, if a large global footprint can be built with no-cost capital, the 'growth' story will likely continue to carry the day for the stocks,"" advises analyst John Murphy.""

""The bullish vibe is predicated on the ability of electric vehicle players to fund their own expansion through the strong investor appetite for the stocks. On that point, analysis from Murphy and team suggest that a 10% dilutive equity raise for TSLA could fund as many as 40 incremental plants and more than 10M units of capacity, which would make TSLA effectively the largest global automaker.""

\- Today they signed a deal with the european commission for 60 million doses over the next 2 years

\- Phase 3 study shows higher efficiency than Astrazeneca

\- Broader immune response not just to the spike protein specifically like with rna vaccines but to all parts of the virus, making this future proof against new variants and a great choice for a booster

\- Can be stored at room temperature and normal refrigerators unlike rna vaccines (less costly and good for use in third world countries)

\- Production in UK, Sweden and Austria

\- They work on two more promising vaccines for borreliosis and chikungunya which don't have an existing vaccine for them yet

\- For the borreliosis vaccine they partner with pfizer

\- Steady growth in the past year

\- Recent capital increase (opening to the american stock exchange, 2 ADS = 1 stock)",0.9732

"You're cold and wet. Your standing outside because you don't want to be in your cheap Walmart, Coleman tent with your wife because she's pissed, so your sitting on a cool travel stool, you bought after seeing a tik tok ad, that can fold up really small... its not very comfortable. You were so excited about the ""integrated stove""... You even posted a wide mouthed selfie on social media to show people how cool it was. But you left it on when you warmed up your Chocolate Soylent last night. You thought your wife would be impressed by your ingenuity but she said she wished you had just brought some Swiss Miss. She also said she wanted a fire but you told her you didn't need one because you could just do the cooking on the *Rivian Stove!* And honestly, you thought it would be easier to find firewood in the forest. She ended up going to bed early, which was a bummer because you were kind of thinking tent sex would be fun! *Oh well, at least you had time to read the new superman comic that just came out. It's so cool that he's gay now!* You pull your mens LULU lemon jacket tighter. This was supposed to be a fun trip, but **you left the stove on and now your new Rivian is dead.** You told your wife, ""look on the Brightside! Your new one+ phone still has service!"". You were able to call the local mechanic and he said he could help you out, he does a lot of off-roading and knows the area. You made sure to thank him profusely. *Are you supposed to tip mechanics? I'll just leave him a really nice yelp review*, you think to yourself. Your thoughts are cut short though as you hear the reverberation of a diesel motor, you grows louder and louder until you its loud enough that your wife finally hopes out of the tent. You both look as a white Chevy steadily and swiftly turns a bend. ""Huzzah! We're saved!"" your wife doesn't think it's funny. *You were just trying to break the awkward silence.* You think \*Doesn't she know its funny because I'm saying it 'Huzzah ironically?\* As the car approaches you start to scramble around, it's a big truck and you want to make sure it can fit next you your Rivian. *I would never get a truck that big. That's why I like the Rivian, it's nice and compact, perfect for driving to the grocery store and running errands.* He pulls up and hopes out of his car. ""Hey"" he says. He must not have seen you wave because it was directed towards your wife. ""Howdy"" you say. But you must not have spoken loud enough because he didn't turn around. *Oof, awkward haha.* You stand next to your wife. ""You guys need a jump?"" He booms out ""it definitely looks like you do hahaha!"" He gestures to your wife who laughs at the joke. you laugh too, but you don't really understand whats that funny. ""So what do you think of my truck!"" you blurt out. ""I'd be interested in getting a mechanics opinion!"" He turns slightly, glancing at the my beloved Rivian.""yeah.. that's interesting alright.. Kind of looks like one of those Mini Coopers.""""Well it's electric! And it has an integrated stove. And I only have one right now because I was able to get on the preorder lists and it actually goes farther than a tes-""""Hey man, that's cool man."" he says with a smile ""can you show me were to hook up the cables?"" you are happy that he think your new Rivian is cool! It takes you about 30 minutes to go through the manual and find out where to hook up the jacks. you probably could have done it faster if Brad had helped, but he him and Stacy were chatting and you never heard a point in the conversation that you could ask your questions without interrupting. Stacy is so nice, she's acting like she's really interested when Brad is telling her about some of the things he does with his truck. But you know she's not really interested in that stuff because she's told you before. Your deal is that you get 10 minutes a day to talk about car stuff (which is hard because you know a lot about Rivian!) haha. ""Alrighty!"" you say. Oops, you should have waited for there to be a lull in the conversation, they're looking at you awkwardly.  You show Brad were to put the cables. Once they're hooked up Brad starts his car and revs the engine repeatedly. ""So loud!"" you say, as you cover your ears with your cupped hands. *I wonder if that absolutely necessary* you think. That's the beauty of the Rivian; It's so quiet. you turned to explain that to Stacy but she was already heading towards Brads truck. *Is she going to ask him to be more quiet? I hope he doesn't get mad.* He Rolls down the window and chats with her for a second, you can't hear because even just idling his truck is annoyingly loud. He pops the driver side door open and you see him scoot over and Stacy hopes in. She starts revving the engine and it's even louder. you wait for a second then walk towards the car. you knock on Stacy's window and she glances over at you, she looks for the button as she continues to talk to Brad. She must not have found it because Brad had to reach over her and press it. The window starts to roll down ""-- and yeah, you're totally right. It does kind of vibrate haha... Yes honey?""""What up, man?"" Brad says.""It's kind of loud-- do you have-- Sorry, it's kind of loud out here. Do you think I can come in too?""""Sorry, the back is full of my tools and some hunting gear I haven't put away yet.""""Why don't you start packing up your little tent, Honey?""""That's a good idea!"" You emphasize it with finger guns because you don't really want them to know that you're kind of disappointed they're not letting you in the truck. As you walk away the the revving of the diesel engine continues. you can barely hear Stacy's laugh as she closes the window. The tent was kind of hard to put away so You just stuff it in the back of the Rivian, it fits really nicely in the compact bed. Brad finishes up with the cables, throwing them onto the back seat of his truck. ""Are we all set?"" You ask.""well, it looks like you have about 30 miles in this thing right now. That should get you to the Tesla charging station at the next rest area.""""hmmm, I don't know if that will work.. can we maybe charge it off your truck a little m--""""Nah, I have something I need to do. I'm sure you can make it work. You seem really.. techy about all this.""""Oh.. alright. Stacy, are your ready to go?"" I kind of have to shout because she's next to Brads truck. She walks over to us. ""Actually, Brad was nice enough to offer me a ride back to our home. It turns out he needed to go that way anyway. Isn't that crazy haha? You'll be fine though, right? You were telling me you can watch movies on the screen in your little truck while you charge it? You can keep watching that one show, the one with the subtitles. Don't worry about watching ahead of me, I'm don't really understand what's going on in it anyway.""""Oh, I thought you said you like Squid Game..."" *She would probably understand it more if she just got off her phone when we watched. I had to explain the political symbolism to her because I don't think she really got it. Maybe it would be easier if we watched the dubbed version but it waaay more authentic if you just use subtitles.* ""Yeah, okay, yeah.. I guess that works.. it will take a while to charge though.. Like hours."" Brad was picking up her duffle bag, and they both started towards the truck. ""That's fine babe. That actually works out great because I think I'm going to take a nap. Al this camping really took it out of me. Maybe if I'm still awake I can make you up some of that vegan mac and cheese you like, maybe. Thanks babe, I really need to get home and lay down, I'm feeling kind of warm."" *That's not good!* I thought. *It's freezing out, I hope she's not getting sick!* ""Oh, okay Stace.. if your not feeling well, maybe I can rub your feet or something when I get back.""""Yeah, maybe!"" She shouted as she closed the door. The Engine came to life again. You step aside as Brad puts it in reverse then starts to take off. Stacy glances at You and you blow her a kiss. She smiles and gives me a quick wave. Before you lose them in the trees. *Shoot! I forgot to tell her I love her! I'll text her really quick.* She must not have cell service because she doesn't reply. *Dumb iPhones lol.* It's really quiet now, and the light is kind of hitting your new truck in a really artsy way. I take a selfie with it and and the caption 'had a great time camping with my truck and Stacy! Looking forward to doing it again if anyone wants to join! #electric4life #future #cool.' You hop in and push the start button and hear a two little \*beeps as it dash panel comes to life. You slowly, back out and start to drive out of the forest. *I wonder if Brad was kind of jealous of my new truck? I'd definitely choose my truck over his any day. I just really like science and futuristic things so this truck really matches my personality. I feel really  good when I'm driving it... I wonder if Stacy will feel in the mood to have sex when I rub her feet. I should have asked to rub her back, I think that's more sensual....I*",0.9998

Wish introduced the ***Wish Standards*** program to incentivize quality products and other positive behaviors from its merchants. The new program, which was announced at Wish’s Global Merchant Summit, measures merchants against a defined set of criteria spanning product quality, shipping experience, customer reviews, refund rates and compliance with Wish policies. 

Merchants who qualify for the program will benefit from commission discounts, expedited payment terms and greater exposure for their products within the app. They will also carry a ‘Premier Merchant Badge’ that will feature prominently across their product listings and merchant store.",0.9666

"$WISH final DD before it's launched into an OBLIVION today🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀 - # HOLD & BUY $WISH WILL FLY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 

I am not writing this DD because my bags are heavy (although they're). WISH is a long term hold for me and I am in for **1600 shares at 12.0 average.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rhnvoa5naqy71.png?width=674&format=png&auto=webp&s=30c7c4a22c586221e131a78d456f5f32c022c60f

&#x200B;

***Financials of the company and why is WISH undervalued & trading lower than many companies***

The Financials of WISH are not as bad as you may think. Let's look at Financials of WISH

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/o5sk8d7mbqy71.png?width=731&format=png&auto=webp&s=a590ae8c2d2fa533b4155cb2cb600602fb1b566c

&#x200B;

Debt to Asset Ratio of WISH has improved over years.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Revenues ](https://preview.redd.it/owdt36yndqy71.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc02f086e986bb4bbfb7a9726f9ef03ad1f08e93)

&#x200B;

Their revenues have been going up YoY, however the reason why this stock got absolutely destroyed in 2021 is because their Net Income was largely affected by Advertisement spending. They did talk about reducing Ad spending in their previous quarter, which would reflect in tomorrow's quarter and upcoming quarters. 

&#x200B;

Now let's look at $NKLA. I AM FULLY AWARE that NKLA isn't a competitor of WISH, but I just want to show you guys how market is underpricing WISH by almost 200%. There are many 0 revenues and non profitable companies out there with 0 products trading at double digits. 

&#x200B;

Look at NKLA's Revenues and Net Income. YET, this company is trading at $14. I am not a finance PRO but anyone with an IQ over 70 can tell that WISH financials are in better position than NKLA and many similar companies. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Lol](https://preview.redd.it/mfyyvczdeqy71.png?width=1568&format=png&auto=webp&s=a67c50739286899b75446a5f97dc942b04f57c39)

&#x200B;

Now, you must be thinking that it's unfair to compare NKLA with WISH. Well okay, let's compare an ecommerce company with $WISH.

Look at JMIA's financials below. The company has never touched 200M$ in revenue and has been reporting negative NET Income just like $WISH & Yet it's trading double digits.

[xd](https://preview.redd.it/6lml9vp3fqy71.png?width=1566&format=png&auto=webp&s=b9ec4034f37cdd17bb86c239656f672aa5e80c54)

&#x200B;

***The company is really active and has made a lot of changes since Q2 Fall.*** 

Events that took place since Q2 - 

* They announced that they would improve their product quality and has been constantly adding branded products on their websites.
* They hired a new CFO who has a solid track record.
* Wish partnered with Klarna.
* Wish partnered with Spanish Carrier, Correos.
* Wish has drastically improved their shipping time.
* Wish now offers same day pickup at many locations.
* WISH has been trying to get into Fintech sector. They came up with WISH Cash

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nswddb3fgqy71.png?width=1605&format=png&auto=webp&s=c1620f8cc52466bb0873bbaf1aaadbf1a28b7ea7

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Will this company be 100$ after tomorrow's earnings? Absolutely NOT. However, it could go up as much as 100% depending on EPS and Revenue Beat.**

&#x200B;

***Why will the company beat earnings tomorrow?***

Let's look at the previous Expected Revenues & Actual Revenues. The expected revenue for Q3 2021 is 373M (ALMOST HALF AS PREVIOUS QUARTER).

If WISH is able to report 500M+ revenues which would be almost 50-60% surprise then this stock could 🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀 tomorrow.  


&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ye6dih3whqy71.png?width=558&format=png&auto=webp&s=73791846746da670a6ec5d0d23c64737013e26f2

&#x200B;

***What to do if stock goes after earnings?***

The IV on this stock is pretty good. Let's say you own 1000+ shares and stock goes down tomorrow then you can simply sell Covered Calls to lower down your average and have that constant cashflow. 

Think of it as an investment into a fixed asset such as buying a property and think of premium from selling weekly covered calls as a rent.

&#x200B;

**PS - WISH T shirts are only $4.00 including shipping. So if you're an APE then you might as well grab some!  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**

"Do some MJ play before it's too late - I don't wanna mark this as DD because it's not. This is just a note from your friendly neighborhood autist.

With all the cannabis legalization talks it's safe to assume we are about to see some action on MJ stock all around the world. If messed up US political system fails, you still have Germany and Mexico to play with.

Just take a few % of your portfolio and put it in MJ ETF or anything you like in this sector.

I think we'll see some crazy ride on some stock, just make sure you get off the hype train before   
 politicians with similar positions. lol. (I'm looing at you Nancy with [Tesla calls](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nancy-pelosi-discloses-1-million-call-options-tesla-stock-2021-1))

Good point. That was a judgement error on Nels part to attach themselves to a bogus platform. In the meantime PLUG has gone and signed big partnerships with Koreans and in Australia.,0.0516

"Every time you sell something, the price of that thing might be different the next time depending on how the market values that thing (I.e. what someone is willing to pay). That's true for your house, items you buy and then sell, or really any asset.

In all cases, you will pay capital gains taxes on those gains. Congrats, you figured out how capital gains works.

The reason that an unrealized cap gains tax is suggested for the stratospherically wealthy is because when you have that much wealth, you have access to leverage that nobody else aside from those in your socio-economic strata has access to.

Elon Musk, and others in his strata, don't extract gains by selling securities like we usually do. They extract gains through using the massive value of that holding to take out massive loans reflecting those gains using the securities as collateral. Because of the ultra-low risk and the highly lucrative aspects to the loans because of their size and low service requirements, typically the interest rates on these loans are so low as to be immaterial compared to gains. Musk's on record using these tactics. 

While they still owe the money back, what the method does is allow them to rotate their capital extraction and choose when to sell to cover the loans themselves. Musk was always going to sell 10% of his shares on this run-up to cover his prior loans. He'd be crazy \*not\* to cash in here. He just happens to have convinced a bunch of gullible people that there was another reason for it. LOL

And he'd be crazy not to... but if you think that he's being asked to pay a tax on something he hasn't derived a gain from, it's only because you don't understand how the ultra-wealthy extract value from their holdings.",0.9823

He’ll still own all 22.8 million shares and they’ll appreciate back up over $1300 fairly quickly. His basis will be the $906 he exercises at, so he’ll just have unrealized gains at that point and absent some new law, he’ll never pay taxes on that until he decides to sell.

This this a dumb post.  Loans against assets are NOT just an ultra wealthy thing.  It is very common for everyone.  What do you think a home equity loan or a cash out refinance is?  Regular Joe’s can also take out loans against stocks ie margin loans.  The only difference between Elon and the rest of us is that his pay is 100% performance based and it is lumpy and irregular in the form of stock options  When he exercises his stock options he pays 53% income tax on them.  But he doesn’t get paid every other week like the rest of us so dumb asses that can’t take an average see there are some years where he doesn’t get paid and thus doesn’t pay any taxes and act like that is some giant scam.,-0.705

Obviously we can all leverage against our holdings, but we do so at a much greater interest rate and with a much higher initial input.

">So you do acknowledge that he has to sell at some point and repay his loan obligations, so then I don’t understand why the need to go after unrealized gains.

You totally missed the point of what you quoted. When you and I take out a loan, we have a crunch between capital coming in and paying down higher interest rates. Their interest rates compared to gains are so low that basically they can rotate loans virtually indefinitely when you have $300b in market capitalization value. They don't have to sell the entire gain every year to keep up with those loans, they can and do play it out for decades, and if they declare bankruptcy they can wipe out the loans.

They don't borrow against the entire lot, they borrow against a portion of it, and the risk of having a complete wipe-out for their holdings (which are not just in one company, they diversify, too) is very, very low. These are some of the lowest risk loans banks write. They aren't zero risk, but they're pretty close.",0.7274
"While I get the logic of that thought and think it's cleaner, it's not cleaner legally. There's already jurisprudence saying that unrealized gains can be taxed based on brackets. 

What you would do for a loan wouldn't be a service fee (that would go to the bank) but rather a tax on the loan. Since loans aren't an asset or an income, it can't be taxed as an asset capital gains or income based on existing court-supported law. You could also run into certain legalities regarding universal access to financial instruments.

Basically, in the worst case scenario if they taxed certain loans, it's possible that a court could rule that as discriminatory lending which operates under special rules, and that would wind up in a situation where all margin loans could be taxed as unrealized gains, which is not the intent and would be very problematic. That could actually cause a market crash by creating a capital crunch.

There was absolutely no push to expand the inheritance tax to everyone. That proposal would have no support from either party and would be DOA. What did happen was that there was a push to roll back exemptions for some wealthy brackets from the requirement. Even if you assume that some people in those brackets might be small businesses that might accidentally get roped in, there was absolutely no intent or legality that would have resulted in the mass expansion of the inheritance tax.

An unrealized capital gains tax on everyone would be equally DOA because not only would there be absolutely no support for this, but because it absolutely would kill the market. Taxing the unrealized gains of the stratospherically wealthy (700 people) who cycle their gains and commonly sell portions of shares on a yearly basis anyway would have little to no impact on the market.

The banks don't lose money this way, they actually make money. Those are considered very low risk loans, but they require excess capitalization. In exchange, they have lower service costs because it's a lot of capital in one loan rather than thousands of different loans at higher risk rates.

What you're missing is that with the amount of capital and assets they have access to, under ideal circumstances they can extract gains virtually indefinitely without having to worry about a capital crunch. The rest of us eventually have to liquidate to cover costs, the uber-wealthy can choose when or if to liquidate and in that way may entirely avoid the tax burden for a long, long time... which amplifies the percentage of capital they have since it amplifies their leverage far above that of the average person.

Without a compensating factor, not only do you wind up with a government funding problem since taxable sources result in less and less of the monetary supply in the country, but also a larger social liquidity problem because less of that money circulates, which further amplifies its ability to generate further capital.

That results in systemic death if it's allowed to continue.

>I don’t see how it’s different than a regular person doing credit card balance transfers to take advantage of 0% offers repeatedly. They wouldn’t be allowed to file for bankruptcy if they have billions in assets.

You don't see it because you're thinking like an average person. The wealthy don't hold most of their assets and capital in personal accounts, they start corporations and apportion their resources to them. This provides a number of benefits including tax benefits, but also allows them to put high risk assets together, then when they default those companies go into bankruptcy. There's a very high profile billionaire who did exactly this in the 90s even though he had a ton of wealth elsewhere in other holdings.

Now, I'm only saying that bankruptcy is an option if they run into trouble... I'm not suggesting they commonly do that and that there isn't a cost. That individual I was talking about is basically blocked from getting loans from many American banks as a result... I'm just saying that these aren't as high risk as people think.

And regarding the 0% debt rotation, it's very different. Eventually, a normal person will get shut down as they accrue more debt while they cycle. Eventually you end up in a capital crunch and have to pay it off.

When you have $300b in diversified equities and other profit and growth assets, you can basically indefinitely go back to the trough.

This isn’t a problem of government funding, it’s a problem with government spending. The government brings in 4+ trillion a year in tax revenues, how much more is enough?

So in one sentence you’re telling me it’s low risk for the banks, then in another sentence you’re telling me about ultra wealthy filing bankruptcy and getting rid of their debt obligations, so which is it?

>Now, I'm only saying that bankruptcy is an option if they run into trouble... I'm not suggesting they commonly do that and that there isn't a cost. That individual I was talking about is basically blocked from getting loans from many American banks as a result... I'm just saying that these aren't as high risk as people think.

But it is risk regardless when their loans are based off of an asset than can fluctuate significantly. But that’s for the banks to determine if it’s within their tolerance.

>And regarding the 0% debt rotation, it's very different. Eventually, a normal person will get shut down as they accrue more debt while they cycle. Eventually you end up in a capital crunch and have to pay it off.

Not if the individual was smart and paid down their debt before it spires out of control, this comes down to personal choice and responsibility.

The Biden proposal isn't to reduce the exemption to $1 million, it's to change the cap gains calculation for a specific asset in excess of $1 million in a taxed estate to be total cap gains, not starting from the cost of the asset at death, which is a tax dodge loophole.

There are good and bad things about doing that... but it's not the situation of ""oh, I happen to have a house that grew to $1 million in value so now my heir has to pay estate tax."" It doesn't work that way.

The proposed change to the estate tax exemption is to bring it down to an effective $6m per taxpayer, or $12m for a married couple. Definitely not in the ""rank and file"" category even for retired small business owners who don't understand how functional trusts and modern corporate structures work.

And it's not a tax against the whole amount, it's a tax against the excess. If you inherit a $3m portfolio and a house worth $3,000,001 dollars, you only get taxed on the extra dollar. So don't worry about having to sell that $1m house to pay the taxes. (an imprecise example, because the inflation-adjusted rate is probably a bit above $6m... but it demonstrates the point.)

"Any tax the government imposes is made up... They change it at their own discretion every few years..... Property tax is something you directly vote for by the community and the taxes stay local or not but that also depends on the state. Just a bit different than the federal government just deciding to do it and telling you what you owe for an asset that constantly changes and can go to zero.... Also property tax is a bill based upon the only thing the local community can assume your income to be and the levies are adjusted based upon the cost of services in your area. It is less a wealth tax and more of this area costs this amount to maintain and housing prices would reflect the costs to maintain so base it off that. The costs are adjusted yearly depending on of the value increases or decreased the previous year. 

There is current legal action in a few states basing property tax on assumed revenue instead of actual property value which is different from other properties. If the courts rule correctly they would have to actually value buildings correctly for once.

">You and everyone else should, but you were the one that was talking about death spiral of being unable to fund the govt.

Saying ""the government should spend less"" is not a response to what is ultimately a major systemic resource suck.

Saying that doesn't solve the aggregative power of being able to have infinite leverage without the any active countermeasure. Musk can leverage indefinitely, for the rest of his life, given the amount of capital he has. And that leverage carries with it inordinate return potential because of the body of his wealth. The same is true for every billionaire because $1 billion is such a significant number above the threshold for not just survival, but overall fiscal hazard, and the potential returns for that kind of leverage are extraordinary... and amplified because they can never be taken out of the game without either making a monumental mistake (like putting all of their eggs in one failed basket, which basically never happens in that strata with the examples of it being legendary... but in most cases even then they still retain inordinate influence) or death.

Saying that you want the government to spend less is completely irrelevant. The government could spend $0 and it'd still be a problem because that kind of wealth aggregation distorts the market. It imbalances the entire capitalism consumer system, and a tax crunch is only one of the eventual outcomes.

Let me be clear: I'm not talking about a hypothetical situation. Heavy systemic wealth aggregation loops are one of the hallmarks of failed states and collapsed nations. In fact, it's not just a hallmark, it's the most common and universal factor in the failure of a society. It is both a product and a cause of state failure because it breaks down the consumer dynamic by creating a liquidity crisis. When you have 700 people with infinite leverage potential and no real competing factor, you need something to counteract it, or the whole thing falls apart.

If you don't believe me, consult with Adam Smith. The distribution of wealth to the artisan class away from the toxic aggregation of the Aristocracy was a central premise to his modeling in The Wealth of Nations.

&#x200B;

>Now you’re putting words in my mouth, I admit they have access to resources, but I disagree on this part, how does a billionaire taking a $1 billion loan distort economic outcome?

I'm not putting any words in your mouth. You can't have expanded capabilities in the economic realm without the ability to distort the outcome.

Saying that you can have added capabilities without the ability to distort is essentially arguing that cause and effect don't exist. I'm simply acknowledging that you're intelligent enough to understand that cause and effect exist.

Put simply: The ability to generate infinite leverage without significant hazard is a significant destabilizing force. I think you simply have a mental block on exactly how destructive that is. The stratospherically wealthy have no competing capital reason not to hyper-leverage, and their wealth provides them with the opportunity not only to have optimal leverage costs, but also access to optimal gain potential.

You expect some normal degree of distortion in the normal economic strata... there's nothing you can do about that, but when you get up to that level of wealth you no longer have the need to consider potential negative outcomes, since infinite leverage results in infinite power acquisition potential. Even if you say it's not entirely infinite, it's profoundly significant to the extent that it has to be distortive. 

As of 2019, the median wealth for a household in the United States is roughly $121,000... and we know that this number has declined in the last 2 years. A person with $200b (accounting for Musk's lost value since TSLA's stock ran down this week) has the economic leverage of 1,652,892 American households... and as wealth goes up, leverage and gain potential aren't linear, they're parabolic.

It is literally impossible for that not to distort the system. You can't acknowledge that these things exist and then say they have no effect. It's nonsensical.",-0.7283

"The Bull Case for $COIN - All your base are belong to us - After-hours trading for COIN is down \~13%. But why?

Largely, it is due to missing ""analyst estimates"", as well as lower numbers (earnings, volume, EBITDA, revenue, and profit, basically everything) than Q2. 

However, this was to be expected. First, Coinbase even alluded to it in their Q2 earnings. Second, there are public trackers that track asset volume (see Nomics).  How in the world did these so-called ""analyst"" get it so wrong, when everything was available to get it right?

Answer: These ""analysts"" are retarded

Here's the down and dirty:

I'll start with the cons, since there are so few:

It's a shitty app. Their customer support is non-existent. It's like Robin-da-hood's support, it's not there. But which other asset app like theirs ISN'T dog shit? 

Now for the pros:

1. As they mentioned in their earnings, they've added a bunch of other assets people can trade. This will only add to potential volume. 
2. They are currently the market leader in volume, total revenue, total assets on their exchange, and profits. 
3. They have not only added assets, but also added NFTs. Another thing to check off the list. Their asset sheet is only growing.
4. They've added innovative features, such as Coinbase Prime (no fucking clue really what that is), Coinbase Cloud (who doesn't fucking love the cloud?), and will soon have payroll and expense reimbursements so people can YOLO their paychecks into assets faster and easier. 
5. THEY ARE ADDING 24/7 LIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT (lmao)

Things can only go up from here (please help me hold these bags)

&#x200B;

3. again, just because they add coins and nfts, there is no guarantee that their revenue increases. it’s not like nasdaq or nyse where the company that gets listed has to pay an annual fee to the exchange. ICOs are generally free if i understand correctly.

"$LPRO why stupid news companies are gonna get crushed - I learned about LPRO from a DD here on WSB and decided to invest. Saw the incredible growth, and solid profitability, and knew that I found a great company. They reported earnings today after hours, and I was honestly shocked to see the price down because I assumed they would have done poorly. So grudgingly, I go to check the actual results and I was blown away. Here were the results:

&#x200B;

**Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 Highlights**

* The Company facilitated 49,332 certified loans during the third quarter of 2021, compared to 20,696 certified loans in the third quarter of 2020
* **Total revenue was $58.9 million during the third quarter of 2021**, compared to $29.8 million in the third quarter of 2020
* **Gross profit was $52.5 million during the third quarter of 2021**, compared to $27.3 million in the third quarter of 2020
* **Net income was $29.4 million during the third quarter of 2021**, compared to net loss of $(71.1) million in the third quarter of 2020
* Adjusted EBITDA was $42.1 million during the third quarter of 2021, compared to $19.8 million in the third quarter of 2020

\-[https://investors.openlending.com/news-releases/news-release-details/open-lending-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results](https://investors.openlending.com/news-releases/news-release-details/open-lending-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results) (Actual earnings)

So I go check out a couple of articles because many of them read that the EPS was a miss, which could have been the case but this is ridiculous. These news companies have literally written the EPS completely wrong. They said that $LPRO reported -0.23 in earnings (which is a loss) even though their net income was 29M for the quarter. I scratched my penis for an hour wondering how a company with positive net income could have a negative EPS and came to the conclusion that these idiots are completely wrong. 

Here are the two articles:  
""Open Lending (LPRO) came out with a **quarterly loss of $0.23 per share** versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.20. This compares to earnings of $0.10 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.""-[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/open-lending-lpro-reports-q3-loss-tops-revenue-estimates](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/open-lending-lpro-reports-q3-loss-tops-revenue-estimates) and [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/open-lending-lpro-reports-q3-001512794.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/open-lending-lpro-reports-q3-001512794.html)

&#x200B;

TLDR: THE MARKET IS TOTALLY MESSING UP THIS GEM OF A COMPANY, WITH INSANE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY.

&#x200B;

I don't want to bring out the conspiracy hat and say a bunch of random stuff, but it just seems irresponsible and frankly weird for these results to be wrongly reported. 

&#x200B;

**I strongly believe that the inaccurate news is a reason why there was a selloff in the companies stock after-hours and why I believe there will be a surge tomorrow when people realize the real earnings.**",-0.9606

Good catch OP,0.4404
"The financials on this company are rock solid with potential for fantastic growth. The drop AH was zig zagging like a mofo. Going to pump at open, and if not, in the next week or so. 

The only way this beauty can go is up.

"Good or bad earnings, many companies are getting whacked 20-25% after announcing. Seems really suspicious on a large scale",-0.5256
"Great catch! Here's the Q3 2021 transcript:

[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/open-lending-corporation-lpro-q3-2021-earnings-cal/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/11/10/open-lending-corporation-lpro-q3-2021-earnings-cal/)

""Net income in the third quarter of 2021 was $29.4 million compared to a net loss of $71.1 million in the third quarter of 2020.""

""We had approximately 126.2 million shares outstanding on September 30, 2021.""

**Net income of $29.4M and 126.2M shares gives EPS of +$0.23.**

Those news articles reported positive earnings as negative earnings.

This stock has amazing fundamentals and this is a great catalyst.",0.9584
"I listened to the investor call, it was 30 mins after upst call. The prices both tanked 20% on release of results. Lpro recovered a bit, but I expect both will plunge further on open. Both are outstanding companies, the market has difficulty valuing them. After it run ups, some funds will be selling off. These are long term holds, this time next year I expect significant upside from both.",0.8271
"UPST did the same thing today. They dropped over 20% after an earnings beat. 

Possible sector issue. The multiples are expenses on these lenders.",0.0
I wrote the other DD and was amazed at the inaccurate reporting as well. Zacks/Nasdaq are reputable news companies too so of course this is causing the sell off. I’d understand if motley fool pulled this crap but cmon. I’m buying the dip!,-0.0258
I'm in.  Good find.,0.4404
Good DD. I picked up some $30 May 2022 calls. I bought in at $2.80 vs the previous closing price of $6.50. A 57% discount! 🚀🌙♣️,0.4404
In trading view it’s reported correctly. Good luck,0.7096
Thanks man!,0.4404

but not on a majority of news sources like nasdaq and zacks. This isn't the only reason btw. I think the company is underpriced for the growth and profitability combination.,0.8519

In order to combat inflation, interest rates go up.

Interest rates will probably be going up in the future.",0.765
not just positive EBIDTA. look a the margins on this fucking cow,-0.4449
Do you really see lower interest rates for another two years? Cause frankly I don’t. If we raise interest rates we won’t be able to pay for fiscal spending because of how high our debt is. This infra bill is gonna push spending up,0.7049

"Bullish on Intel $INTC - AMD and Nvidia stocks are going to the moon recently and while I am also bullish on AMD (it was the first stock I ever bought, back in 2018 at 12$) I think everyone is overlooking Intel. I know last few years they were struggling and they are still stuck on their 10nm process but the 12th gen CPU's finally started competing with ryzen, and I think they are getting back on track.

And their valuation compared to AMD and Nvidia seems like a bargain especially considering Intel has Fabs unlike other 2 (though if they are losing money on them it could be a drawback)

"I agree that Intel is a pretty undervalued play, but I see them as 2-3 year play as they create Fabs in Europe. Mind you, we still don't know how the market will really react once the Fed tapers so you're exposing yourself to that risk if you're playing for that long. 

Currently, the climate is such that there's both price momentum and popular sentiment going for AMD and NVDA. Unless you've got the capital to influence the price it's easier to just follow the trend of the time. The trend seems to be to ride the Mama Su rocket ship to the moon.

I still believe Intel can turn this around and Gelsinger could do it. He might do it too, as he has already kind of “divested” the fab business ready to be available for other customers too in the future. But it’s going to take a while.",0.7311
"To those that thinks Intel is like AMD, they're very different. Intel is fab first then microprocessor designer second. They're at the top when they have the node leadership. Those years of intel dominance is because of their node leadership. Now they lost that node leadership and their momentum is taking for the worst.

They're fighting a losing battle against TSMC, especially when Pat announced the $26B investment on their fabs and said that they will produce 5 nodes in 4 years and regain the node leadership by 2025. I don't know what flavor of cool-aid he is taking but 5 nodes on 4 years is insane! especially when they're stuck with 14nm for god knows how many years and their 7nm (or now called as Intel 4) has been delayed until next year.

" intel are getting back into gear . But I think this is too early. 2023 is when shit really gets interesting for intel. Sierra. And the path to that is very much up in the air given amd being this competitive

Amd are on a roll and their counters plays have been simplistic in relation to what intel needs 

Amd: stack another die on top of zen3

Intel: hybrid compute is a must to compete. A total new uarch E core etc 

Point is as much of a feat CoW is, it's most definitely less resource intensive compared to designing a new uarch. Validating two unique cores, even more so

What I suspect that means is zen4 or zen5 is a mean competitor that has had a lot more engineering time put into it than usual. They basically get a extra year for uarch development due to CoW playing off

Intel do not have a full run yet, I think there's defo more risk atm give zen3d is like a month away and could really sway who's leading here

Personally think it's still currently overpriced. The fab section of the company is overvalued just like globalfoundaries was. They might have idm2 but name really even 3 other customers other than intel.  Without customers the fab is worthless and no customer is going to move to another fab unless they have equivalent features and are price competive

And to add they need to invest an ungodly amount of money for these next nodes to keep up. It's not cheap by any means

Data center is the money maker. Sierra in 2023 is all that interested me on their roadmap if that flops wheres the money coming from for these nodes",0.9276
"Im with you on INTC. However I take issue with your statement about INTC starting to compete with Ryzen. Intel chips have always beaten Ryzen. AMD hasnt had a top performing chip in like... well ever. 

Ryzen was just AMD going from incredibly inferior to a little bit inferior. And Intel hardly had to do any tweaking to stay on top. Like you said, theyre still outperforming ryzen with 10nm and less cores.",-0.5954

"My Target buy price is a bit lower than the CMP.

And, AMD is milking everything PR wise at the moment. Lisa Su delivered! Far more than I thought they would. Disclosure: I was in the AMD train for a good time frame pre to post Covid.

However, Meta accelerators are going to be designed in house if they are actually useful.  Apple did it, Microsoft did it and Google did it. Fab design is pure logical skill set. Sure, AMD can milk it for now but not sure for how long.

Additionally, AMD has a major major key supplier risk. If TSMC messes up their nodes due to any reason, they’re royally in shittown. Could be due to geopolitical(Taiwan-(?)), technological, labour or any reason.",0.743

Intel’s new business model is to fab chips for others, particularly in the US.

They pay 40-50% lower than an equivalent job in apple or nvdia or AMD. This is mainly because a large chunk of comp is usually sticks and Intel stock has been garbage compared to the others. Intel is also losing talent to the likes of google, amazon as they are throwing money at chip folks for their server chips.

"Eh. I own all 3 stocks so I'm somewhat neutral. Amd won't catch nvda on the gpu front. Except for a few circumstances nvda always will outperform. It doesn't really matter how good an amd gpu is their driver support is terrible and if a 700 dollar gpu that performs like a 1500 dollar gpu sounds good, which it should but in reality it doesn't matter because the drivers are crap and real world performance always lags benchmarks. 

On the cpu front. I'd only use amd cpus on a workstation. The higher core count per dollar is nice but my 5950 system with a 2080ti never ran as well on 2k as my 9900k system with the same gpu. Both have ram tailored for the system and adequate cooling using msi mobos. This is in cod warzone which is heavily cpu dependant. The 9900k is at 5ghz both use noctua 2 tower coolers. And 32gb of b die ram. The amd system has memory tailored to the infinity fabric frequency as well so don't give me that frequency crap. The issue with the 5950 is I get frequent stuttering and lag fps drops. Not network related. If I spin 360  between the downtown and airport runway while on the hill ill lose 50fps. Dropping from 150 to 100 around the time I'm looking at array. 1440p same settings as my 9900k but fir whatever reason my 9900k system doesn't have these stutters when replicating.

Netflix and the newest AMD customer, Facebook are using AMD server part because of how AMD can customize their tech according to the clients need.  Chinese tech companies are switching to AMD given the fact that during the Intel's latest earning call they said a weak demand whereas when AMD asked the same question AMD answer that the Chinese market has the same level of demand for their chips as the previous quarter.

As their main business. 
Intel make CPUs. NVIDIA makes GPUs. AMD makes both. 

AMD wasn’t able to get in server segment, was mostly a candidate for PCs and laptops for many years. Now they are growing strong in that arena. Meta deal is a big proof for that. If they grow in server segment they are bound to eat the market share  of intel. So if you are comparing PEs of AMD to intel then market perceives AMD to be a better growth stock than intel and is willing to pay more for the stock. Look at your profit on the capital you invest and the stock you buy not the just the PE ratio. Intel is a giant in microprocessors AMD has a lot of room to grow and eat away intel’s monopoly. Being a high growth stock I would be bothered even if their PE worsens, till the time they can continue with the growth. 5-10 year or who knows even earlier Intel might be ready to eat AMD’s monopoly.

Samsung is probably the only back-up.  But their tech is not upto the same throughput as TSMC nor is as cheap.

And, on the foundry business gaining edge, the next best chance (the world has ie,) is Intel picking up slack. No one else is going guns blazing at the moment nor can they, because of ASML as you highlighted. Intel has got some supply lined up for a good number of EUV machines I believe.",0.9313
"it certainly was on the downwards trend however with the new management i think they are turning around the company, but obviously it will take time

thats why it's a long term play",0.5859

"both gpu and cpu are microprocessors...  

intel is getting into gpu market

amd has 180 billion market cap compared to intels 210 so basically all the growth is already counted in

and the major advantage of intel is that they have fabs and actually produce their product and can sell production capacity to others while neither nvidia nor amd actually produce their chips",0.5574
"""benchmars"" are a shit measure

"processor wise?

for production, power efficiency, and process node (thanks to tsmc) - AMD

for gaming, (and imo better future plan with high and low efficiency cores) - intel",0.8957
"> Intel is a better company. AMD has been in the red for over ten years, and their stock price reflects that. Intel’s market capitalization is $245 billion while AMD’s market capitalization is only $12 billion (despite having more than twice as many employees).",0.4404
"Always has been better. (Intel performance wise)

Edit: i get it. Theres fanboys out there that are impressionable and bought into AMDs marketing campaign with no regard to reality.",0.6124
"The play for INTC isn't necessarily that it's process nodes will be cutting edge (like they were).

It's that they can build out and operate their own fabs and hopefully win over Google, Microsoft, and Amazon as customers for their own custom chips.

That's a 2 to 3 year play so you gotta be willing to buy some cheap leaps.",0.9186
"All true, but your point was ""TSMC messing up their node.""   
My counterargument was that I don't think it is likely to happen in the near term and if TSMC was overtaken by another FAB business there is no reason to think AMD wouldn't retool in time.  
Basically AMDs ""Key Supplier Risk"" is, in my view, probably lower than Intel's exposure to problems with their in-house foundries.",-0.7096
"My bad, You are 100% correct both GPU and CPU are microprocessors. 👍🏼made the correction.",-0.5423
"Lol. You better read closely where the charts with AMD having bigger bars says ""render time, (lower is better) ""

This is a dumb argument. AMD has not released a top performing chip to date. That is an indisputable fact.",0.0021
"Have you heard about AMD's efficiency cores? It's the cores inside the 128 core epyc to be released late 2022. Waaay better architecture. Also... My brother can't even play his fav game on a computer he just spent over $2000 to upgrade (new Mobo,ram,CPU,psu) because of some bug in their chips. It's a failing company, don't get blinded by uPsiDE and potential that will continue to be wasted.",0.5106

"amd's 5000 series has been all around better than intels 11th and earlier gens

and before that amd was better for production tasks and value wise",0.8834
"I wasn’t referring to an industry leadership change in node development by TSMC but rather about the capacity to deliver on the pipeline in the very near to medium term by TSMC.

TSMC can mess up their highNA implementation that’s in batch testing at the moment. Or it could be external factors as I suggested- geopolitical, environmental (water). They’re locked into Taiwan for most of the advanced node production.

And AMD is not ready in any shape or form to switch suppliers. Samsungs 7nm/5nm EUV node is not the same design as that of TSMC. Current chips will have to be revised(probably not a major redesign) but still an effort. That assumes Samsung will have free capacity, which they don’t, not to the extent AMD would need. And I’m very sure that there’s no other Supplier who can do 5nm/7nm nor will there be for next 2-4 years.",0.4625

i give up trying to educate you",0.296

It’s intel that went efficiency and high power cores way that for example apple is also going 
And “your brother” is a shit argument",-0.5499
"Thats just not true. The only category AMD has ever been on top has been ""value"" because Intel charges a hefty premium because they can get away with it having the fastest chips.


https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i9-11900K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-5900X/4110vs4087

A 5950x barely beats a 9 series intel chip overall. And the 9900k STILL wins in gaming. 

https://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i9-9900K-vs-AMD-Ryzen-9-5950X/4028vs4086",0.5374
"In that case, we are mostly in agreement.",0.4939
"It sure looks like intel only went with the hybrid architecture because their process improvements are so far behind schedule. AMD hasn't needed separate performance and efficiency cores because their cores are already so efficient thanks to TMSCs processes. AMD is, probably, going to easily retake the desktop performance crown with zen 4.

More importantly, they're eating intel's lunch in the more lucrative server market. Yes, market share is still in Intel's favor but there losing share to AMD which means companies are switching. Intel hasn't said anything about using this new architecture in their Xeon lineup. Their newest chips are based on their shit 11th gen architecture.

Intel needs to get their shit together on the engineering side ASAP.",0.1515
"Supporting big little kind of arch on windows is going to be a flaky prospect. 

And, Intel is only 10% up on gaming due to their complex instruction set and slightly higher consistent single core clock speed. Both are bad for power draw as you can imagine.",0.1531
"go look up amd's new dense core. will be as efficient, if not more so, than intc shittle cores. amd has not talked about it much yet, only hinting to it. you will see.

Whats your beef with userbenchmark anyway? Real world result aggregation not your thing?",0.509
"Sure, although it’s practically impossible to measure exact power draw due to different motherboards, ram config, and other things around the whole set up. :-)

Point still stands on the gain vs cost. At some point, industry will get forced to optimise code for non-specific x86.",0.6808
"it was a joke, sorry. you know what subreddit we are on... it was basically a compliment. anyway, can you link me to a list of busted games from AMD? i am sure there are one or two out there, but this list has dozens. how could that get past QA? its a bad sign.",-0.3818

Now I should say that I don’t think this will cause the actual large crash but it’s one pillar that’s weak in my opinion and there are many more.

The evergrande fiasco. Now I should say that i don’t think this will cause a very large crash but will cause uncertainty and will be a factor leading up to a larger crash. 

To be out simply. Evergrande is going to default, modern land china has defaulted. China has 8 trillion in bonds that need to be paid. Nearly 30% of Chinese economy is real estate. Ghost towns are being created(this is obviously map investment). To be put simply Chinese economy and private firms will struggle to pay back the bonds of the economy goes into the shitter. These home developers defaults and foreclosures will spread to other firms. Contagion will spread to the US as funds own these bonds. Already happened in 1997 when contagion occurred. This is only the start. Think of this as the equivalent of bear sterns.

"The CPC can do literally whatever they want. They have shown themselves to be pretty adept at threading the fiscal needle thus far. I wouldn't go so far as to say China is crash-proof but a severe economic recession without some obvious external cause (plague, war) would be an existential threat to the legitimacy of the current system of government.

Let's wait and see what China does with this. Remember that it was 6 months between Bear Sterns imploding and the sad times, and exiting the market early would have cost you an additional 20% in growth.",-0.9607
"Keep going, i know about the 60T in housing also. I also understand that china is a producer, and this will definitely impact production, that will lead to retail in other consuming countries to strugle and just inflate the prices more (supply and demand) this will accelerate inflation.


(The text under is just my opinion)
If I'm understanding this correctly the debt is in USD and here again we are at supply and demand. The USD will rise and lead to stock markets fall, this might help partially against inflation, but not for the common people. 

While all this happens, there is still the possibility of higher rates and taxes, that will also lead to higher value of the USD and lower prices overall.


Please share your view, I'm interested.",0.8685
"I agree with your last paragraph. I have long positions open anyway because who can really predict the future there are so many possible outcomes and timing is always tricky. I just keep enough cash on the side and have adequate tail risk hedges in place and I’m not buying any more shares unless it’s GDX or rebalancing my portfolio. I see many problems and areas I think will fail/crash/dip. You are very much correct about bear sterns too. It takes time for the failures to work its way through the economy.

Although what you’ve said is true in first statement in the last paragraph I think this won’t always be the case as I don’t believe that in the long run you can smooth the business cycle. In my opinion it’s the case of “it works until it doesn’t” on a economic scale instead of our tiny shitty portfolios. Eventually it comes to an end. Booms result in busts and they don’t have to be major busts but they always occur. In my opinion what the Chinese have done in their housing sector and top down central planning in housing will be the beginning of their dip/crash. Ghost towns are the broken window fallacy on a large scale. It will spread to their banks and will therefore spread to their other markets in China and then globally.",-0.9004

"Start Preparing For Tax Season - If you can start doing your taxes.

Start doing your taxes.

It'll help you know what to expect for next tax season and if you've got a taxable account it takes quite a bit of time inputting the data for the trades.

I shudder to think what it would look like if I was a day trader.

There's still a little bit of time to massage your losses. I foolishly was asleep for a decent chunk of the year, but there is still time.

If you've got gains to harvest. Don't forget about the pattern day trader rule.

The end of the year is rapidly approaching. 

With the end end of the year. This tax year will end.

You'll just be left with a final quarter payment and possibly throwing funds into a traditional IRA.

Good luck.

For the sake of discussion. 

Have you started doing your taxes?",0.8573

"Is there enough in the tank for $FCEL to run? - **$FCEL – FuelCell Stock Analysis:**

\*You can find supporting visuals in my original post found [here](https://utradea.com/positions/Is-there-enough-in-the-tank-for-FuelCell--FCEL-Stock-to-reach-)\*

**Company Overview:**

$FCEL is a global leader in sustainable clean energy technologies, focusing on energy, safety, and urbanization. FuelCell provides their proprietary hydrogen and carbon capturing technologies, which if commercialized, represents a large opportunity and addressable market. 

FuelCell provides solutions to their business, utilities, and government (and government-related) customers worldwide. These target customers are typically the large-scale power consumers, however there are some smaller-scale customers especially in small European countries. No matter their size or power consumption, FuelCell can craft/provide a solution for them.

FuelCell’s business model includes 3 main streams of revenues, which include: Power platform/component sales, recurring service revenues, and renewable attribute sales. These streams of revenue will be discussed further in the “Investment Information” section of this report.

**Investment Information:**

*Long-Term Strategy:*

I believe that this position will be geared to a longer-term hold, and as a result of this ideology, taking a look at their long-term strategy makes the most sense. FuelCell has a 3-pillar long-term growth strategy which covers the following:

1. Transform:

This pillar focuses on building a strong balance sheet that will help them achieve long-term financial health and success. This includes improving their liquidity, which they have already taken strides to doing so in 2020 through their public offering. Typically, public offerings are frowned upon by investors, however, they are using the proceeds to build a foundation/framework to deliver long-term results to their investors. Overall, from a long-term investor standpoint, I do not mind this, as long as it does not get excessive, and they have clear plans for how they plan to use the proceeds. Additionally, FuelCell focused their efforts on getting their cost of borrowing down, which will help them to lower their cost of capital. This should help FuelCell get the funds they need for future projects/expansions, also, this is good for long-term investors as they are making efforts to reduce their cost of capital, which will make the DCF and their business more attractive to long-term investors.

2. Strengthen: 

This pillar focuses on making the necessary investments into enhancing performance, lowering costs, and generating higher returns. Furthermore, this pillar focuses on addressing their backlog to secure stable sources of funding moving forward.

3. Growth:

This pillar focuses on product/service development, FuelCell wants to offer the best products and services, and they believe the best way to do this is through continued R&D efforts. Furthermore, FuelCell is looking to strengthen their customer relationships to generate streams of recurring revenue, and to leverage these relationships into potential expansion opportunities down the line.

*FuelCell Advantages:*

FuelCell has provided the following list of advantages of using fuel cells:

· Fuel Cells can instantly generate electricity from readily available fuels (ie. Natural gas)

· Scalability (especially on-site components)

· Reduced costs 

· Ability to provide carbon-capturing and hydrogen production.

  
 Furthermore, FuelCell has provided the following infographic (found in the original post [here](https://utradea.com/positions/Is-there-enough-in-the-tank-for-FuelCell--FCEL-Stock-to-reach-))which compares Fuel Cells to traditional energy generation techniques. As you can see in the image below, Fuel Cells may not be the best choice for every individual category, however they are by far the best all-around choice for energy generation.

*License Agreements:*

License agreements can provide FuelCell with various benefits especially in their current development stage. The agreements can help them to improve their technologies, at a significantly reduced cost. Currently, FuelCell has 2 License Agreements, which I will quickly cover:

1. ExxonMobil Research & Engineering (EMRE):

FuelCell and EMRE entered into this Agreement on October 31st, 2019, and this agreement states that they will work together to continue research and development efforts in exchange for: 

· A $5M technology access fee (EMRE pays FuelCell), which allows EMRE licenses and rights to the research and development for their own use.

· Up to $45M contributed from (EMRE to FuelCell) for research and development efforts.

· Payments of up to $10M from (EMRE to FuelCell) for reaching set out technological milestones.

· EMRE having certain rights to licenses.

This agreement can help FuelCell to drastically lower their R&D costs while being able to make technological breakthroughs in their product. Although they may be foregoing some revenues now (as Exxon will be able to use these technologies for significant discounts), FuelCell will be able to lower their Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE), which will make their services more attractive (lower user costs), which should generate long-term, sustainable revenue streams.

2. POSCO Energy:

FuelCell and POSCO Energy first entered into a Cell Technology Transfer and License Agreement (CTTA) in 2012. This agreement gave POSCO the right to manufacture, distribute, and sell select FuelCell products. Part of this agreement includes FuelCell receiving a 3% royalty on POSCO’s net product sales and replacement sales. However, in 2019, POSCO spun off the Fuel Cell side of their business and tried to avoid any liability they had to FuelCell as part of their breaching of the contract. Later in 2019, the Korean Electricity Regulatory Committee violated South Korean Laws. In 2020, FuelCell notified POSCO of their breaches of the contract and gave them time to fix it. However, instead of meeting these requirements POSCO decided to go court.

In hindsight, this was a very bad idea as this legal battle dragged on for months, and FuelCell came out victorious and this contract was officially terminated and POSCO had to pay FuelCell all of their legal costs, and the damages FuelCell incurred as a result of the spin-off company (up to $200M).

But the drama did not stop there, as POSCO filed an $800M lawsuit against FuelCell in late 2020 which did not seem to materialize onto anything. 

Overall, FuelCell received $86M of funding from POSCO for research and development efforts since 2007. This funding was crucial for FuelCell and helped them to evolve their products into what they are today.

*R&D Costs with Licensing Agreements:*

Just to show you how much of a financial impact these licensing agreements have on FuelCell, their 2020 total research and development costs were $21.05M, and only 22% of that cost ($4.8M) was paid by FuelCell. These agreements help FuelCell to maintain low operating expenses, while being able to develop the technologies that they are able to develop. Some of their competitors have R&D costs of $35.5M, $27.9M, and $551M. Assuming their R&D costs decrease proportionally with their market cap, these companies would exhibit R&D costs of $17.3M, $4.1M, and $27.6M. This puts FuelCell right on par with their competitor with the lowest (relative) R&D cost.

*Share Dilution:*

FuelCell has a long history of rampant share dilution, and their dilutionary habits still exist today. Just in 2021 alone, FuelCell has increased their # of shares outstanding by over 13%. These levels of dilution are very unfavourable for investors even knowing that there is a large potential for $FCEL to grow into.

One of the biggest factors of this year’s dilution was through FuelCell’s Open Market Sale Agreements with Jeffries LLC, and Barclays Capital Inc. This Agreement warrants a total aggregate offering price of up to $500M. With prices near the $10 mark at this point in time, the offering was capable of bringing approximately 50M shares to the market.

Based off of $FCEL’s shares outstanding data, it appears as though 44M shares were purchased in this offering and are the sole reason for this years share dilution. This announcement of the agreement was the main catalyst in $FCEL’s 3-month downtrend starting in June of 2021, which decreased the value of their stock by over 50%.

*Revenue Backlog:*

As of FYE 2020, FuelCell had $1.28B in backlogged revenues. In their filing they noted that this revenue could take between 1-20 years to get recognized on their financial reports, however, due to their rapid growth and long term plan, I believe that they can get this done over the next 10 years. This revenue by itself represents the total amount of revenue that FuelCell will generate over the next 10 years. This implies that my DCF model is undervaluing FuelCell, and we will talk about this later.

**Investment Valuation:**

*DCF:*

As observed in my DCF model (linked below (in my original analysis)), we can see the $FCEL has a fair value of $5.52/share, which implies a downside risk to this investment of 49%. However, from their backlog of revenues, we know that this number is underestimating their revenues, and as a result of this the DCF model will have a 20% weighting toward the overall fair value of FCEL.

*Comparable Analyses:*

*Price to Book (P/B):*

My P/B comparable found the fair value of $FCEL to be $10.12/share, which implies a slight downside risk of 6%. This is very reasonable, and we will see if this is consistent throughout the other comparable ratios.

*Enterprise Value to Sales (EV/Revenue):*

When comparing $FCEL’s EV/Revenue multiple to that of their competitors, we can find FuelCell’s fair value to be $6.37/share, which implies a downside risk of 41%. This is not consistent with the previous result and is a rather low estimate. As a result, I underwent one more comparable

*Debt to Equity (D/E):*

$FCEL’s D/E ratio indicates that their fair value is $30/share, which represents a potential upside of 181%. This is also not consistent with the other results, which led me to taking an average of the 3 comparable analyses. 

Average Comparable:

By taking an average of the comparable analyses, I found $FCEL’s fair value to be $15.60/share, which indicates an upside potential of 44.5%.

**Overall Valuation:**

By taking a weighted average (20% and 80%) of $FCEL’s DCF and Comparable valuations respectively, I concluded a final $FCEL price target of $13.10/share. This estimate indicates a 21% upside to this investment.

**Conclusion:**

FuelCell is a quickly growing renewable energy stock that has a good long term growth plan, low R&D costs through their Agreements, and are currently undervalued. The biggest negative about FCEL is their high levels of dilution. Overall, my price target is $15.60/share, which implies a 21% upside.",0.9995

"Interesting read. The point I don't understand is why inflation would be self-reinforcing. The argument seems to be that labor costs will go up because of the expectation that inflation will continue to rise.

But a key point is that supply is already at the pre-pandemic levels for goods. So technically we should be able to meet all essential needs. I'm assuming most essential needs are goods, not services (like restaurants).  The increased demand in goods won't be sustained as economies open up, which the article points out. So we are only worried about increased demand in services, while labor supply is short. While expectation of inflation would temporarily apply upward pressure on wages, as essential goods' price comes down to normal, the risen cost of services should bring demand down, no?

Rising interest rate should also bring down costs of asset prices down.

"Not sure if you didn't understand my statement, or the article.

For my statement: OP shared the article to r/econ as well.

For the article: The article argues that inflation is not transitory and is instead more long term

The evidence it uses to back up this is: 

1. A claim (without evidence) that people are making just as much as they were prepandemic without working. The claim is not backed up with any evidence.

2. A bunch of evidence of short-term transportation isses that are causing short-term inflation

3. A claim (without evidence) that the number of workers won't increase because, worldwide, a bunch of people 65 years old (and older) decided to retire

4. A bunch of evidence of short-term manufacturing issues due to lack of raw materials causing a lack of production.

5. A claim (without evidence) that production is at a higher level than it was pre-pandemic.

Somehow, Bridgewater is arguing that yes we are having manufacturing & transportation issues causing inflation BUT wages have risen so much that the only way to get inflation under control is to convince all of the world's senior citizens to go back to work but because they all spontaneously decided to retire that won't happen so we'll be chasing inflation for years in a hyper-inflation hyper-wage loop.


Anyone who is familiar with Bridgewater isn't surprised by the contradictory nature of the analysis; they also have a policy of ""radical transparency"" to eliminate bias that has been shown in court multiple times hide a LOT of bias (especially in employment practices) behind smoke-and-mirrors of pretending to be transparent.",0.6987
"It contradicts itself more than once in order to push an opinion that the evidence provided in the article shows is not to true.

Additionally the entire basis of it, that somehow Americans being flush with cash that the average American doesn't actually have, is somehow creating a worldwide supply  shortage -- is absurd. It has been shown dozens of times by dozens of economists that the majority of the money that came out of stimulus went into bonuses and stocks, of which retail investors own less than 10%. The increase in real wages that we are showing is compared to last year when people were laid off.... But when compared to 2019 or 2018 total wages are still down in the US. If you take ALL savings and devide it by all households, savings is up. When you break it down by financial groups, 80% of the country is worse off financially. If 9 people with $0 are in a room & Elon walks in the average net worth may be in the billions, but 9 of those people STILL don't have any money - so claiming their newfound wealth is causing prices to rise is an idiotuc lie.

You posted the same article in the economic sub. You've also posted in the past a clear indication that you don't understand monetary Supply and inflation - you seem to believe that there's an equal sign in between those two and not understand that it's a formula with multiple inputs on both sides. How fast money is being spent on how many different products is also within that formula and we significantly slow those numbers down.

The doom-and-gloomers were wrong about runaway inflation when looking at lumber prices, it came down in a few weeks just like we Economist said it would.

The doom-and-gloomers love to point out gas prices while ignoring the fact that our refineries have the largest drop in of production in history during the Texas freeze and that production has not picked back up.

Thousands of economists worldwide, including every Nobel winner, has shown that this is short-term inflation. Every time some financial analyst or politician who can't even pass high School Math decides to point to something and say hey look the price of THIS proves inflation -- whatever it is that time goes back down in price and they just move the goal post to something new in order to maintain their opinion while ignoring the facts.  

Your article it's from an investment group who has a history of contradicting themselves and they did a wonderful job of it here too -- proving transitory inflation and then claiming permanent.",0.6409

"Yeah. I was intially intrigued by Bridgewater, but I have found that they're not as refined or principled as they preach.

I agree that too many people are assuming that 60 year olds will just continue with retirement. The argument isn't settled and all bets are off if rates rise and the stock market crashes.

100k Amazon truck order?  ARVL has a 100k EV truck order and it currently sits at $12

I didn’t buy Tesla at those prices but I did buy it when it was valued around 50 billion in 2019.  At that time they were shipping 367k cars a year.

"Lol WHAT? Explain your logic.

Lucid is valued higher at $72 billion and Rivian has hundreds of more vehicles delivered and backed by Amazon (with 20% ownership) with a 100k truck order.

"Not really. They do need to show continuous growth in production but the R1S & R1T line only has capacity for 65k units a year (similar to Tesla's Model S & X).

The real volume and profits will come from the two new factories and the more affordable vehicles they will produce.",0.6858
This is kind of where I am. Tesla has the scaling down pat especially considering many automakers couldn't get enough chips. Rivian has a long way to go to prove that they can do something similar.,0.0
How can you not buy puts on LCID before earnings??,0.0
"Because I have learned in about 7/10 times it is better to do JUST THAT. 

Run up before earnings and often a dump right after they are announced.",0.0772
"Gross margins aren’t profits, it is the difference between revenue and cost of goods sold.  If they have negative or poor gross margins they can never get to profitability no matter how many trucks they make.  Tesla has always had positive gross margins even though they were unprofitable for many years in the past decade.",-0.9102
"But I think it’s different with an EV startup like Lucid, especially with how well Tesla is doing and the excitement over Rivian.",0.8909
I think lucid will end up being one of the 3/10 not the 7/10 you reference,0.0
It's not something I'm at all concerned about. It's hard for me to think of a scenario where they won't achieve positive gross margins.,0.5859
Well they will have PLENTY of competition for business. They have a long way to go and right now everything is basically pie in the sky.,0.2732

""RYAN CANT SAY ANYTHING"" yeah. I heard that one a LOT. Worst thing is it's completely false. Yes he could have, and still can.

""Look at what we do, not what we say"". Well Ryan, since youve SAID nothing we cant fucking look at it anyway. And since all youve done is make an e-store it doesnt justify the price.

Even if gamestop made tradable game NFTs, which is a great idea for the consumer, there is no guarantee that other companies will comply with it. Theyd have to have their own console/launcher to accompany it.

And since thats all speculation ANYWAY... the price is already what it would be... like... the price discovery happened. And the timeline for something of that scale is 5... 10 years? Ryan already made some 5000% on his investment, if not more. He has ***zero*** obligation to stick around as soon as hes allowed to sell his shares lmao

"Bond(age) Play - I just spent my life savings ($10,000) on TTT (an ETF that shorts 20 Year US Treasury Bonds). My wife’s boyfriend wants to know if I’m retarded or if this will work out. 

So I’ve been tracking the bond market for awhile now, thinking I needed to wait for a good time to strike. I figure that with the government spending money and the fed beginning their tapering of bond purchases it has to put some upwards pressure on interest rates, right? And sure the fed sets the rate but they can’t control the market and when the market softens the fed has to respond. With the massive new infrastructure bill passing there is more debt being created and therefore more bonds being created (supply). The fed will stop buying 120B worth of bonds each month (demand). I know this isn’t an original idea or anything but these etf’s are short term. What are your thoughts on my timing?",0.6544

umm I don't know much about the bonds man... and I think we have that in common. But im pretty sure most investors will go running to them if stocks start to look to risky.

If they constrict the money supply too quickly or if they go the opposite route and decide tapering is a bad idea I’ll be getting out.

So around $48 but, this will really be news driven. So I wouldn’t be in it unless you’re watching the fed news cycle.",0.3228
Listen to the post above. You need to unwind this as fast as possible. Ur betting heavily on a repeat of the taper tantrum from 2013 but seem to be missing a few key points the biggest is that it was a panic move that was brief and that if history was repeating itself this would have already happen. Also there was much heavier participation in the bond markets at the time and bonds had been making good returns at that time. Currently bonds have been a poor investment compared to stocks so the relative participation has been lower. It could of course still workout in your favor but this seems like a low probability play imo.,-0.6124
120 billion a month decreased by 20 billion a mont means they’ll stop being a net buyer in six months. Did I get a number wrong somewhere?,-0.6124
"Thanks - I’m tuned in enough to FED policy to let it ride for a while. I did zoom out to the 2013 run up before purchasing April 35C’s. I’m also interested in the correlation to the equities market for TTT. If markets turn bearish, wouldn’t money flow more in to bonds?",0.6808
Oh shit no my ears must be bad I heard 10 a month starting in jan?,-0.8519
Yes. As a general rule of thumb more money turns to bonds when stocks go bad. That’s part of the reason why stocks are strong now. The opposite is true as well. Investors don’t trust bonds to keep getting lowers so those that are flexible between bond and stock ratios are leaning more towards stocks.,0.8779

Just stick to regular PayPal services.

Does Amazon generate the cash back, or is it your credit card? Do those credit cards also generate cash back when paying through PayPal? And if your credit card has quarterly bonus cash back with certain purchase categories, are PayPal purchases one of those bonus purchase categories?

Making a payment is making a payment, regardless of how you do it. If the seller is giving points, they'll accrue no matter how you pay. And if the rewards are generated by the card/payment issuer, it'll still accrue if the payment is middle-manned by PayPal.

I am an algorithmic swing trader, may have chances to come positive at the end.Here is my algorithmic output [https://imgur.com/d5xKuDR](https://imgur.com/d5xKuDR) and it rare to see superbuy for big companies like PYPL.

I am only skeptical with Dec 17, 2021 $270 call (0.81 is current price) as the DCA is $3.5. I may have narrow chance to win, but rest of the calls, esp Jun 2022, I have brighter chance to gain. In some accounts, I have 2023 $300 calls, that is positive even today.

In another account, where stocks are not allowed, today I purchased low thousands of shares of IPAY (which has V,MA,PYPL...etc mobile payment etf) at $64.35 avg price.

"Rocket Lab ($RKLB), A Real Rocket to Hop Onto - There was a small amount of hype for this company last month, but I wanted to remind you in case you got distracted and forgot that this play is a thing, and they have earnings on the 15th. Isn't that exciting?

[It has a rocket on its logo. Bullish](https://preview.redd.it/xwvfwuo4iny71.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&s=a7919da585ec69338f00f377f90a18db56919d8d)

Ill list some of my reasons for liking this rocket company.

1. They have received the contract for NASA's first Artemis launch, as NASA begins building the necessary infrastructure for further Lunar missions. They will be putting a single cube sat into a highly technical, unique, lunar orbit launching in March of 2022. This is additionally important because it would be the first time their trademark Electron and accompanying Photon satellite bus would carry a payload to Lunar orbit. That's huge! But why? A lunar orbit has been done plenty of times before (*~~or has it?~~*), well, what if I told you the Electron rocket is one of the most cost affordable rockets available on the market at the moment. The successful launch of a NASA satellite into lunar orbit via an Electron and Photon configuration would open up lunar satellite launches to many different countries, organization's and even private citizens. Forget a lambo, I want my own moon satellite. 
2. The launch window for their next mission, *Love At First Insight,* opens on Thursday night, US time. This will be the first launch of a series of three for the same customer. With a proven track record of successful launches, I spy with my little eye no reason to believe this launch will be any different, except that it will be their first launch since IPO. Additionally, it will be their first live launch including ground experimentation with helicopter recovery.
3. You read that right. Helicopter recovery. Let me clarify, that while they will not be recovering this booster by helicopter, they will be making a dry run at it, to investigate its possibility further, as they already have with static aerial drops. [Rocket Lab | Mid-Air Recovery Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3CWGDhkmbs) As they continue to develop this system, we could see potential that a booster could be recovered by helicopter, landed back on the launch pad to refuel and be inspected, have a new payload added and be launched again. Makes a lot more sense when you consider that Rocket Labs main launch site, the Mahia Launch Complex in New Zealand has potential for a very rapid launch cadence, and so does their Electron Rocket. 
4. Lets look at the bigger picture of what this company is. They're filling a niche market, providing solutions for launches that otherwise would not be economically feasible. They are *not* looking to be SpaceX's competition, although they could someday, if they wanted to, but at the moment, its simply not in their interest. Their Electron rockets are small, agile, and resusable, and can be tailored to almost any low earth orbit.
5. They are currently in development of a larger rocket, Rocket Lab Neutron, which is expected to be operational by 2024 and will launch from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport in Virginia.
6. I want to mention again that this upcoming launch will be their first launch since IPO, considering that a month after IPO the stock price reached a ATH of $21.34 on Sep 9th, I see it having significant potential to bounce back to these numbers as they keep pushing out more and more news. 

For these reasons, I now consider RKLB to be the best aerospace play of the year, and consider a price target of $25 feasible. Ill be buying more and more while it is still on sale.",0.9879

"I don't think they share the same target market. Starship will serve much larger launches (i.e. large cargo missions, space telescopes, large satellites, interplanetary missions) whereas RKLB's Electron rocket launches small satellites. Even Spacex's rideshares don't cover the exactly the same niche as Electron as some satellites need to be launched into precise orbits which are impossible to achieve through rideshares.",0.4019
I’ll take one ticket please,0.3182
"Double you S bee didn't start gaining traction until voice to text. 

Source colon double you double you double you dot google dot cum",0.4215
"Except if Starship beats Electron on price as Electron still has an expendable second and kickstage there will be nobody that wants to fly. You don't even need to be doing rideshare. If Electron is $5M and Starship reaches $2M per launch then why would I fly on Electron?

Even if not, SpaceX rideshare is already giving most of the advantages that Electron has. The ability to launch on demand and not be dependent on a main satellite. Most satellites do not need to go to an extremely niece and precise orbit. SSO with MVAC precision is good enough. We have already seen companies like Planet who had those needs switch to SpaceX rideshare as their main launcher.

If it Starship can't get precise enough insertion then that is where I think Rocket Lab will come in with Photon and the Kickstage.

Electron will be most useful for things like constellation replenishment. Eg if OneWeb lost a satellite they could actually go to that specific location in that specific orbital plane. Photon and other space services will be the big moneymaker for Rocket Lab.

I do own Rocket Lab specifically for that reason. I think that Neutron will be the dominant launcher for internet constellations as nobody (Kuiper) wants to fund their competition. And Photon seems quite useful.",0.9528
"Right, but I don't think it's very likely that starship will beat electron's price for an exceptionally long time considering they are both going to be reusable and that starship would burn more fuel to reach the same orbit merely as a consequence of its far greater size and weight.

Personally, I think Astra's, ABL's, Relativity's, and Firefly's rockets (if they ever reach orbit) as much closer competitors in Rocketlab's market, but it's impossible to know until these things develop further. You might be right.",0.6532
"How long? 10 years? 15? SpaceX says it will get to $2M an they have a good track record.

And fuel is a negligible cost. For F9 the RP-1/LOX costs 200K. But for Starship fuel production will be in house. All you need is water, air and electricity. It seems SpaceX is already working on the on site fuel plant. Musk [says](https://www.space.com/spacex-starship-flight-passenger-cost-elon-musk.html?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=dlvr.it) fuel costs per launch will be $900,000 and $1.1M to cover launch and recovery operations.

But the difference here is that Electron can't reuse its second stage. That's where the cost difference will be. They are not in the same league. Electron will hopefully become partially and rapidly reusable. Starship will be fully and rapidly reusable. Fuel costs just don't matter. Especially not when comparing a partly reusable vehicle to a fully reusable one.

I think that Rocket Lab can get to full reuse in fact they are likely the only other launch company that can. But this will need to happen very quickly before everyone gets crushed by the boot of SpaceX and needs to go ask the markets for capital.

&#x200B;

In the beginning I agree. Operations cost will need thousands of Starships flying daily before it begins to seriously encroach Electron. (Imagine if there were only 10 aircraft that existed. Even if they were reusable the airport costs would be insane.) But eventually it will happen and Rocket Lab needs to absolutely sprint to survive without extreme pain.",0.4859
"It's great to hear we agree, and sorry for dragging this out for so long on a subreddit dedicated to being mentally handicapped.

I would just add that I think that in the time it will take for Starship to encroach on Electron's price range, either Rocket Lab would have already been outcompeted by one of the other smallsat launch startups (though at this point that doesn't seem that likely), or Electron would already have become Rocket Lab's secondary launch vehicle, as they are working on Neutron. In that sense, their Electron's mission space would not be entered by Spacex for the length of its intended operating period. That is why I don't see them as close competitors.",0.8519
">Neutron

Neutron is not fully reusable. The booster is fully reusable but the second stage is still expendable. Neutron is much closer to Falcon 9.

Yea Rocket Labs goal looks to be diversifying away from depending on Electron. Hopefully they do well with that.",0.7351
"You're right (vis. Neutron), sorry about that.",-0.0772

"SORRY Marketwatch ain't a viable domain   


[PG&E could be a ‘big beneficiary’ of $1 trillion U.S. infrastructure bill](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pg-e-could-be-a-big-beneficiary-of-1-trillion-u-s-infrastructure-bill-11636397623)

&#x200B;

Embattled California power giant Pacific Gas & Electric could be a “big beneficiary” of the roughly $1 trillion infrastructure bill passed by Congress on Friday, given the legislation’s focus on bolstering the nation’s power grid, according to a new report.  
  
The bill, a pared down version of President Biden’s initial infrastructure plan, allocates roughly $25 billion to power transmission and distribution, with a focus on “building out new capacity and increasing reliability,” wrote a CreditSights team led by Andrew DeVries, co-head of U.S. investment-grade credit, in a Monday report.  
  
“One provision we are surprised has not been discussed more is the $5 billion provision for preventing outages and enhancing the resilience of the electric grid to ‘disruptive events’ defined as an event in which operations of the electric grid are disrupted, preventively shut off, or cannot operate safely due to extreme weather, wildfire, or a natural disaster.”  
  
PG&E Corp, PCG, +4.91% California’s largest electricity provider, was tipped into bankruptcy in 2019 for the second time in about two decades, after its equipment started the 2018 Camp Fire that destroyed the town of Paradise, as well as other mega fires.  
  
Last year, the utility emerged from Chapter 11 in the unusual position of having more debt than it had before, while struggling to pay out claims to its near $13.5 billion fire victims fund. The fund was created as part of plan to exit bankruptcy.  
  
Read: The hedge funds that left wildfire victims holding the bag on PG&E stock  
  
PG&E outlined plans in July to bury 10,000 miles of its power lines in high-wildfire threat areas in the next several years. But more recently, its equipment also is suspected of having a role in starting this year’s massive Dixie Fire, the second-largest on record in the state.  
  
Read: Climate risks are bearing down on American utilities, especially in California. Rain may help, says Barclays  
  
Shares of PG&E were off 0.7% Monday, while it 3.5% coupon BBB- corporate bonds due in August 2050 also were under modest selling pressure, according to BondCliq data. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.31%, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.35% and Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -0.60% were pushing deeper into record territory.  
  
A PG&E spokesman said the utility applauds the passage of the legislation, including its proposed appropriation of $5 billion through 2026 for extreme weather-related grid resilience improvements, in a statement to MarketWatch. The statement also pointed to the bill’s ability to “reduce customer costs for investments around undergrounding, grid hardening, microgrid implementation, fuel reduction and other critical wildfire mitigation measures.”

&#x200B;

The approved infrastructure bill also includes some $7.5 billion to help build out a network of electric-vehicle charging stations and other EV charging-related initiatives. Shares of electric-vehicle charging companies, including ChargePoint Holdings Inc., CHPT, -6.45% soared Monday, as did those of EVgo Inc. EVGO, +10.20% and Volta Inc. VLTA, +1.25%",0.7958

Last ER had weak guidance but it still ran 25% afterwards over the couple days till the inflation fears kicked in but raising price negates the inflation fears so I think we can run 25-50% by mid next week.

# US Market Wrap - Financial Juice

* As treasuries rose, US stocks paused their longest advance since 2017, bringing key indexes lower from all-time highs.
* The S&P 500 index dipped for the first time in nine sessions, driven by a decrease in banking stocks, which were hit by a drop in the 10-year yield, which fell to its lowest level in seven weeks. Following a tweet by investor Michael Burry, Tesla dropped as much as 13%.
* PayPal dropped after the company's guidance fell short of expectations. General Electric soared after announcing that it would be split into three businesses.
* Investors are weighing robust earnings, easing travel restrictions and US infrastructure expenditure against the possibility of sustained inflation, which might lead to tighter monetary policy. The producer price index rose in October, adding to concerns about inflationary pressures in the economy.
* On Wednesday, new consumer price data could contribute to the monetary policy debate, which saw another surprise on Tuesday with reports that Fed's Brainard was interviewed by Biden as he considers whether to re-appoint Fed's Powell.
* In the meantime, positioning adjustments have spurred advances in long-end Treasuries, bringing the 30-year yield to its lowest level since July. The yield on the US 10-year note has dropped to 1.44%.

"The SEC report states a lot of price action was due to shorts covering and they show the short interest drop in the report. The report states that shorts covering was not the primary factor in the surge to ~$500. Algos and FOMOs jumped in as shorts were covering which was the primary driver to the peak. All this means is that the peak would have been lower if price action was just shorts covering. Example, without the meme stock hype it might have only jumped to ~$100 (pure speculation on my part for illustration). 

Just because SEC states shorts covering was not the primary driver of the surge does not exclude the shorts from covering during the surge. The corresponding drop in short interest following the surge is in the SEC report as well.",0.5213

I had this exact same thought earlier the ratio of stocks tanking vs rising seems to be like 10/1 for earnings.,0.3612
"MSN-news ( retail taking gains etc.) and the way this sell-off happened are quite „strange“ . I mean… I don’t like conspiracy-theories but they want to tell us that suddenly all small retail-traders decide to take gains at Tesla etc at the same time and no one can stop it ( Look at Nvidia or Tesla)?!? Then you have  the fed insulting „meme-stocks“ for high-volatility at the stock-market + some article about Evergrande/China + some news about inflation probably going up to 6% …. Tbh.: today felt like someone tried to pull out money… this day at stock-market did not feel „natural“. If you ask me ( remember: I don’t like conspiracy theories): seems like something like a market correction might happen soon.
Sorry for my bad English and greetings from Germany",-0.5286

"Palantir Technologies (PLTR -8%) is sinking like a stone despite beating on revenues in Q3 while guiding Q4 revs nicely above consensus. The data analytics software company, shrouded in secrecy due to its ties to the CIA and other US intelligence agencies, is struggling to get back to the all-time highs it reached in February, shortly after going public in October 2020; shares currently trade lower by 45% relative to those highs.

We think the selling pressure mainly results from PLTR's rich valuation of about 30x forward sales, which leaves very little room for error. In that context, posting EPS that is only in-line with consensus and growing revs by significantly less than in the prior four quarters isn't enough to rouse investors. In addition, PLTR guided to a fairly decent drop in adjusted operating margins for Q4. After four consecutive quarters with operating margins at or above 30%, PLTR now expects margins of just 22% in Q4.

In Q3, EPS fell 50% yr/yr to $0.04, the same as in Q2 and Q1. Meanwhile, revs rose 35.5% yr/yr in Q3 to $392.2 mln, topping consensus but not quite living up to Q2's +49.0% growth or Q1's +48.8%. Both commercial and government revenue were fairly decent in the quarter, growing 37% and 34% yr/yr, respectively.
Over the past year, lingering concerns have surrounded PLTR's ability to continue securing certain US Government contracts, especially after US troops exited Afghanistan. PLTR did put some of these concerns to bed by winning a major Army contract back in early October. However, total government revenue growth came in much lighter than the +66% yr/yr growth posted in Q2 and +76% growth in Q1. Although this category spans revenue from governments worldwide, it could be weighing on investors' minds today.
A bright spot was PLTR's continued addition of commercial customers, increasing 46% sequentially in Q3. Furthermore, US commercial revs leaped 103% yr/yr, signaling strong interest in PLTR's data analytic services domestically. Although this does lead to some concern that PLTR could be seeing additional hurdles abroad, with many developed countries outside the US taking longer to recover from the pandemic, we don't think this is of particular concern.
Finally, looking ahead, PLTR expects revenue to jump 29.8% yr/yr to $418 mln in Q4. Although this outlook easily topped estimates, it nonetheless represents continued slowdown in quarterly revenue growth. The good news is that PLTR reiterated its long-term guidance of at least 30% revenue growth for FY21 and for the next four years.
The main takeaway is that investors are unimpressed with PLTR's in-line Q3 earnings growth and slight revenue upside. It also didn't help that government revenue growth was fairly light relative to PLTR's past couple of quarters. However, we think that there are still catalysts on the horizon for PLTR. The company's work in the mobility industry has helped speed up certain aspects of different companies' supply chains. PLTR also works in the health care industry, supporting many different companies, such as the National Health Service and the Department of Veteran Affairs, which could lead to further renewal of contracts after many healthcare companies benefited from the use of PLTR's services during the pandemic.

Bottom line, PLTR looks to be an excellent play on the rise in data analytics. However, with its rich valuation, the stock may see additional selling pressure in the short term, and it may be better to wait on a further pullback before entering the stock for the long term.",0.9984
Its also due to the massive dilution from stock- based compensation.,0.0
"With 2B share float feels like this stock should be around $5 and a $10B valuation not $48B and then it would go up...instead $1.4B annual revenue continues to sink it.....everything is priced in from now til 2025, unless they get some billion dollar contracts rolling vs. million dollar contracts.",0.5719

I could sell at the open but I am not sure if holding will be more profitable in the end. I could also theoretically hold until Thursday after the earnings are released but let’s face it, not many earnings have gone well this Q. I could double down too even thought my portfolio dropped 20% today.

I’ve seen maybe 2 of them in the past year. They’ve basically disappeared from the road. The burnouts that thing could do… man, had no idea it’s coming back.

Gonna look up the specs here shortly, but is it going to have a similar power train? Or is it hybrid or something?

Edit: oh shit it’s called the lightning because it’s fully electric, not a remake of the supercharged beast from the early 2000s. My b.",-0.431
"I think Ford will reign in a large chunk of the electric market with first time electric buyers and more common man, myself included with a Lightning reservation. Some people want electric cars that don't scream ""I'm driving an electric car!"" I'm in my mid 30's and have worked in the automotive field in the past, I went to a Ford Lightning event that I was invited to as a reservation holder a few months ago that is usually just for dealers and etc, I spoke and interacted with a lot of people like your dad. They were both very excited about the truck and very eager to learn about the truck and electric vehicle as a whole. There were a lot of ""normal"" blue collar working class folks walking around and very friendly, there were 2-4 Tesla's in the lot as well. I think it being a traditional manufacturer like Ford gives people more confidence and even if there are issues they can drive to any of thousands of Ford dealers for parts and service if needed. That vs whatever the current Tesla service call/center is, and in turn however you'd get an issue with a Rivian resolved, or a car to use while being serviced.

Ford introduced a crate electric ""engine(motor)"" this past week and already sold out on this $4k motor meaning there is even more interest for not only vehicles but a market parts for an aftermarket. The F150 will be a huge segment but electrified vans are just as important for the plumbers and electricians which are also very compelling. There is strong demand for their Bronco both the full size and sport versions, the new Maverick is also drawing a lot of sales and interest.

Also if the bill passes in current form will provide not only the $7500 ev credit going forward but up to $12,500 for qualified vehicles like the lightning, that's a lot of essential free money for Ford as you know they will price the F150 damn close to that $80k limit and people will gravitate to that price point with the credit/rebate. With the bill is also a large chunk of change for charging infrastructure as well which also chips away at a advantage with their Meroe

Sorry for the novel, but reading this post helped me push past my mental hurdle of investing the past few months. GM may be pushing for ev but they have a different approach of top down with the most expensive cars first like the Hummer, I think Ford is right timing right place right now.",0.9937

You are 100% right about Ford. If they can hit on the F150, this is easily a $100/share stock in the next 2-3 years. They are trading about 25x earnings-ish, vs. a TSLA trading 200-300x earnings. F-series is the best selling car in American and as a fleet truck, they'll sell millions.",0.8834

"Doesn't the standard range only have 230 miles of range? This is already a small battery so you can't really have a smaller battery than this on a truck. I doubt Ford will do discounts on these unless they can't sell them. Also remember that they are only planning on making 80 000 F-150 lightning a year, that is a very low number in this business. They could ramp this up if they see that the demand is good enough, but then you have the problem with supply chain and specifically battery supplies. I do however think an electric F-150 will see big demand.

You can question how big the upside is for Ford though. If Ford converts every single current F-150 buyer into an F-150 lightning buyer, is there any upside or does that just keep them at the same revenue as today? If they are cannibalizing their own sales they aren't actually growing.",-0.5729

The price range is insanely wide varying here between models and starter base platform vehicle with no upgrades is 40k? Who in their right mind…..Also, is this truck going to be all wheel drive? Expensive tire changes if so. The previous lightning was a disaster on wheels whenever the weather conditions weren’t perfect for driving, any moisture and there is zero grip to the wheels.

They already have the 2022 lighting and e-transit highlighted on their fleet vehicle page.",-0.3182
"You're not wrong, there was a Syclone. The Typhoon was just the GMC Jimmy/Blazer version.",0.3724
"I don't think you understand what a real fleet's bulk order looks like - think multiple thousands per year or guaranteed sales. Ford will get the city fleets in a lot of areas(Mach-e is showing up there already). They have a history of catering to that market, and the market is loyal because of it. 

Not sure how AWD changes the tire change price? You'd need to elaborate as I can't even guess.

As for traction/power, this is where any EV shines, any ICE powered vehicle pales in comparison.

Ev allows as much power as possible ), instantly, with out slipping to each wheel, changing on the fly in microseconds if slippage happens. Braking offers similar advantages.. The control an EV has on the road is IMO the true gamechanger. Get the range on these to consistently be above 300 miles = ICE offerings will die quickly.

Now, Ford/EV shilling aside, for this sub on long positions, I would think that investments in the battery end of industry would be better, then you're just betting on batteries taking over, which is assured (aside from some revolutionary breakthrough in physics/energy creation/storage).",0.9125
"Msrp is only a suggested retail price. Dealers can mark up to whatever price they feel is comparable to its competitors. Hence, more demand for the vehicle will raise the prices of these, not lower. In my opinion of course.",0.0245
I'm guessing Ford will also price the upper trims like the Lariat specifically right up to the $75k-80k limit on tax credit eligible cars. They more than likely have been in talks with people who were lobbying for more beneficial tax credits so they have not released pricing since the EV credit is also free money for them as they can add the credit on top of MSRP now.,0.9587
"That's not passed yet.  It also removes the 200,000 vehicle cap, and for non-union vehicles, it's $8000 (So, yes, Tesla gets that $8000).  It's also a point of sale credit (After Dec 2023)

Also, Ford did say it'll be profitable even at $39,974.

Ford also said MSRP only, no discounts allowed.",0.7777
"Nonono, I understand what fleet bill orders do for the promise of a sale but in what way does it has this ever actually lowered previous prices of the F150? Doesn’t seem to have had past effect and I doubt it will for the future as well. 

As far as awd, it was just a thought I wanted to hit on at the time. With all wheel drive, all tires should be changed at once so it makes for a costly change in one go(not saying it’s a bad thing). I’d love an AWD F150. 

I also understand the EV power distribution is immediate. AWD does nothing to help against icy conditions though as AWD/4WD does not equal all wheel stopping on ice. 

I’m not bashing or loving any of this only, concerned that this will not be the true price of the vehicle is my only point.",-0.4076
"Yes and no. Dealers can markup what they want but they are in competition with each other and there are things like ford X plan where they can't go above the pricing ford says.

If you look at the Bronco its sold out everywhere but when dealers get them in they aren't selling them for a huge markup over msrp",0.765

Second, i layover in Vegas *a lot* and the casinos have similarly idiotic rules as you’re allowed to take a drag off a cig and expel that shit from your lungs into the air but you simultaneously have to have a mask on at all times. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. 

Thirdly, some bitch coworker who i hope to never work a flight with again made us TURN THE FUCK AROUND 30 minutes into our flight because a some poor mom who was legitimately trying to make her 4 year old wear a mask couldn’t get her child to wear a a mask without ripping it off. WHO FUCKING CARES?! we allow them to remove their mask to drink their Jack and Coke (only in first class though because flying is classist as fuck) but even the peasants in coach get to take it off to eat their peanuts so who cares about a four year old?! Ughhhh!

I straight up don’t fucking care. I hate wearing a mask too (I’m vaxxed btw, team Pfizer!) but these hoes are doing the absolute most.

I feel you bro, the only thing that matters in the options game when deciding to take profit is how long you have until the expiration date. Letting a LEAP run when it's up 100 percent is way different than letting a monthly run when you are up 100 percent.

You'd be foolish to hold that monthly because theta is gonna kill you. However, on the LEAP you can afford to ride the waves. All my calls are at least 3 months out because theta doesn't start to really fuck you until 45 days till expiration.

3. Tipping on the card is expected. Ordering directly from a place, I always wonder if the delivery guy knows if I tipped on the card or not, and I feel obligated to have cash and tip. Very inconvenient.

""Oh yeah, I love going out into the woods and cooking with electric!"" fuck no, give me a $5 Coleman any day. Electric vehicles in the wilderness? Yeah, that'll go great. Have fun getting a jump from Dan's diesel Chevy as your wife jumps *him*! Fords electric truck looks like a truck at least, not a hopped up Mini Cooper with vagina shaped headlights. The Cyber truck is ugly as fuck but at least its something new and has the TSLA name behind it. WHO IS THE TARGET MARKET? Seriously, give me a marketing avatar of someone who is going to buy this? I'll wait. This shit is so stupid and I can't wait for it to fail. Fucking mark my words !Remindme: 3 years ""Rivian is shit"" .  My only regret is that the market is too stupid to understand how useless this truck is and the IPO will probably pump. Looking forward to the crash though. Glad the banks/funds will be taking dumb money. Go on to any car reddit, r/overlanding, r/Offroad, r/OffRoad_Jeeps, r/Tacoma, etc. These are all the target market AND THEY ALL ARE LAUGHING at this abomination.   


*In before* some nerd lists of a bunch of useless stats that 100% of consumers are too stupid to understand or don't give a fuck about. I've seen them, I don't care. Most of those stats will get beat within a year by someone else. Are ya'll even old enough to remember how Tesla had to fight tooth and claw to get market share?

"Actual question... what do yield rates actually mean for the stock market?

When they're rising, borrowing is harder, making it harder for companies to grow (bearish). But also, rising rates means that less people are looking into safe bonds, which seems good for stocks (bullish).

When they're falling, borrowing is easier, so companies can grow quicker (bullish). But also, falling rates means that more people are purchasing safe bonds, which seems bad for stocks (bearish).

The stock tanked the rest of the week and my calls expired worthless 3 days later. I think about that every day when I buy or sell options now and I've made a decent amount of money since then, but I still kick myself for not selling.

If you sell a call and sell your underlying, there is unlimited downside. You could lose waaaayy more than the price of the shares.

"The latter, but only kind of. It is a signal for more risk-off type investments, but only when coupled with high inflation and only if interest rates are going up, regardless of what the Fed is doing. If the interest rates aren't really going up except for bond yields, that could just mean the price of bonds is falling while maintaining the same percentage. That's people selling off bonds, which is bullish on stocks. You can't look at any one indicator under a microscope and expect to know what's going on bigger picture. 

If I were to see a rapid decline in bond yields, without any increase in the interest rates, I would be looking for a massive spike in the VIX, followed by a huge market selloff because it means people are rapidly buying bonds without the better risk/reward ratio (hidden risk?) and a big spike in VIX is pricing in a large directional move, which sounds like a crash is either about to happen, or currently underway.",0.7166

"What’s the Bull case for tomorrow’s CPI release or just in the near term? - Core PPI was released this morning with a target miss impacting supply chain, but what’s the bull case for tomorrow’s CPI report?

A target hit would endorse and encourage FED’s continued tapering of 15b reduction in asset purchases and the timeline of hike in interest rates which are both contractionary monetary policies. Bearish.

A target miss on the upside might signal further stagflation impacting primarily the middle/lower class consumer spending. Tapering would still ensue most likely. Bearish.

A target miss on the lower side (unlikely) might signal an accelerated speed of tapering and a pull on the time horizon on interest hike lowering aggregate supply of money. Very Bearish.

So what’s the upside?

Position: weekly QQQ puts rolling over every week.",0.8573

"Thoughts on Hertz? $HTZ - Trading again (finally) and we all know this sub loved hertz when it was bankrupt. Now the company appears to have some real fundamentals. After the recent move in AVIS, I think it is possible Hertz could make a big move so I am in despite the risk.

&#x200B;

The Acquisition of the Tesla models might be the start. What is they start making orders with other EV makers or traditional OEMs? Thoughts on the potential? Any of you getting in the stock? Also, I am considering the possible catalyst of WSB taking a liking to the stock. If that happens, who knows where this thing could go.

What are your thoughts folks?

Summary: I am all in on team #HertzToTheMoon

Position: 11/19 $35 C x10",0.5878

"Saw this late. Doesn’t look like your call worked out for you. 

I’ve been in on $HTZ since the summer and it’s been a bit of a roller coaster. It had a lot of good momentum up until Elon took the wind out of the sails after the announcement of the EV buy. It’s been declining pretty steady all week, so doesn’t look like a great buy right now or is the best time to buy during the dip and right before all the holidays. To be clear I currently have one share in $HTZ and the rest are in the warrants. The one share is me being lazy and wanting to get the news feeds easily as you don’t get news on $HTZWW on my trading app for whatever reason. 

Something of note is that something like 471 million shares are not tradable and won’t be till Dec 30th. That being due to rule 144. I imagine the price will take another dip when they are.

Not a quality investment, if you have pizza/candy money to throw away on Hertz stock, sure; but there are so many other speculative stocks that have better chances of growing.

"DD inbound - Bullish projections on $BBBY - Opportunity to evolve your smooth brains to have at least a few wrinkles so take out your pad, we're diving in.

[Look at the shares float](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=BBBY), its sitting at 100M. If you don't know what that means, consider it the free floating stocks available that are being held by people and can be traded at any moment. Meaning can be bought and sold anytime. Now, here's the important part: [A few days ago they announced an absolute fuckton of money to be spent on buying back their own stock.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-02/bed-bath-beyond-soars-on-share-buybacks-plans-for-marketplace) 400M worth.

With a market cap of 2.18B, that's  0.4/2.18 = 18% of their whole market cap. THAT IS INSANE. If your tits aren't already perked up from hearing this consider the sharp reduction in shares float. $400M tendies / $21.64 share price = 18.5M shares. Taking this off of shares float is, similarly, an 18% concentration of stock we'll see. If you're still confused I'ma need you to add another wrinkle right now in that peewee brain because what this means is that there will be less sellers and more buyers as more shares are kept with the big boi company itself.

Normally this doesn't mean much. AMD is doing a buyback program along with MSFT and several others. So what makes this different?

a) the sheer investment/market cap ratio. AMD for example is $4B investment/ 180B market cap = 2%. thats dogshit.

and more importantly

b) the fact that they want to complete this buyback program by the end of February. The short duration of it is the most critical aspect of this because that means this upward trajectory is going to be aggressive as fuck! And it means it can be calculated.

TLDR reasons to buy in:

1. an enormous amount of capital thrown at itself increasing market cap by 18%
2. a sharp concentration of stock since float will be reduced by 18%
3. execs are showing how big their balls are with their confidence in our face because they're strongly suggesting they think the company will keep growing.
4. bitch will moon by February

So whats the play? We're going with the May 20th, 2022 Calls at the $23 strike. I look forward to seeing your posts of thicc gains.",0.9378

You’re probably right :/,0.0
"Lols, that would’ve been the baller play, but Feb gives me another board meeting for them to suggest a split go to shareholder vote, in case I’m wrong about today.",-0.5346
If it splits in 5 they automatically give you 5x the number of calls and divide the strike by 5. The total dollar value of the premium and date are unaffected.,0.296
"Give me until tomorrow, I think they aligned on it but they want to get the Form 4 out first. Theories are calculated guesses I theorize.",0.1154
"Thanks, they finally disclosed Monday’s trades, those weren’t all of them, they still need to file the Form 4’s for Elon’s trades yesterday, and with tomorrow being a government holiday not sure they can do that tomorrow, so my timelines are botched. Still think the split was approved by the board Tues but not disclosed until the SEC filings on Elon’s sales are all done later this week.",0.4971
"Will you refer to me as daddy if one is announced tonight? They’ll technically announce that it’ll need to go to shareholder vote since they are currently only authorized to have 2 bil shares, so a 4 or 5 to 1 split will require SH vote, but obviously that vote would be a shoe-in.",0.1531
Only mentally. Though it’s up 20% at the moment so I don’t need excuses yet. I hear I can always reinstall the app if things get bad though.,-0.5423
I'd you post your losses of 100k or more I'll give an award lol,0.5574
That’s my pursuit of happiness,0.5574
Nice $20k green day for ya.,0.4215
Interesting thought. I’m not sure he cares that much about his shareholders though. He’s a smart guy but a monumental narcissist as well. All of these stunts just feed his ego and give him validation,0.4817
"Holy shit, i was thinking the same thing but only yolo’d in shares. God speed brother!",0.7003
"I can see the point and I’ve been having the same thesis as well. It sounds stupid when you say it out loud but we’re seeing the same pattern as last year. Plus it’s in his best interest to split so it adds more to the stock and when it splits, the average joe can afford a few more shares again",0.9244
Srsly how u got this info?,0.0
"Oh I see, wish you a lot of luck… But why you bought a call when you know it’s declining? In the future, it will grow, but dont know when…",0.431
Valuation makes zero sense.even if you separate each TESLA business it doesnt make sense to be at 1T,0.0
"Well, I hope I’m wrong considering you have skin in the game. Good luck!!!",0.7783
Ive been think they will split if maintained over 1k like last time. I bought the day after split. What makes people it is imminent?,0.3612
I kinda don't want to but you definitely will get props. I missed my chance back when they were $200/ea before last split. I'd be sitting on as much as you if not more. Sigh,0.4262
lol. I think that’s how that works,0.4215
"Thanks man. They were slow filing Monday’s Form 4’s today and I don’t know if they can file yesterday’s tomorrow with the holiday, so my timeline is botched, still hoping for the split this week after Elon’s sales are done and disclosed.",0.8126
"Fair, but he’s always tipped his cap to those loyal to him against the short sellers and media, and those are the retail investors. He has said don’t invest in TSLA if you’re a short term investor, but he knows what the poll and selling did to us.",0.7003
Same. You did the smarter play.,0.6597
"Copied from another reply I made, sorry if anyone sees this twice but: The Tesla board meets every couple months, I know they met today. Elon wants to offset the pain his loyal shareholders just received from doing his poll and sale (the latter of which he basically had to do since he has options expiring soon). He and his bro wanted to do that before today’s meeting and split so they don’t get wrecked for insider trading, ie, after the split. The Twitter poll was for the memes and to offset blame. But he feels guilty for selling when he said he was the first in and will be the last out. He knows the split will fix this dip.",-0.8047
"Thank you. I knew it would sell off during the day as GS or MS or whoever sold the blocks of shares for Elon, but I think it had been all sold by the end of the day when I bought them.",0.2263
"Sentiment does not give a fuck about that. It was overvaluated at 300 dollars and look where it is now. Every bear ever was wrong with doubting tsla. I agree with the price not making any sense, still bought calls today.",-0.0387
"Elon’s poll, and him and Kimbal’s selling before their board meeting today where it would be discussed.",0.0
I hear that. The fomo is real. I’m probably wrong about all of it.,-0.4767
"This is some serious BS, innit?",-0.0772
"TLDR; you made it up 

Well done.",0.2732
Hmm sounds with sens. Thx for info!,0.3612
"Karma being a bitch and all, for you hopefully it offers a way out of a difficult spot. 🍻",-0.5574
Might be but it sounds good. Buy the rumor?,0.5927
"Theories are always made up. I still think it’s happening. Maybe they’re waiting for Form 4 to be filed, and announced tomorrow.",0.0

"what do you think it gets corrected to if things go sour?

the institutional investors I've looked into so far are long on it as well.

averaged at 70 sold some at 94.

might sell some of it if  it gets to 150-200 too fast.",0.2732
"I'll put it this way. I am neither selling nor adding. Market cap is 14 billion, with like $450 million a year in revenue; by that standard, this is probably overpriced for now, although most ""tech"" is. Probably a fair amount of the price increase is the hype. Since DOCN caters to small and mid sized business needs, unlike Amazon Web Services or Microsoft, they will never win giant government contracts or anything (one can dream though!). That's the bearish case.

On the bull case, DOCN sold $1.3 billion in convertible notes (by 2026), pricing them at like $170 per share. Basically, whoever bought those notes (essentially call options the company will exercise themselves) thinks this stock will reach at least $170 per share by 2026. DOCN will be using these proceeds for general purposes and a stock buyback, among other things, and they don't really have debt. DOCN says there is a huge market for them (around $116 billion by 2024), so there is certainly room to grow.

Basically, if you think this company is the Shopify of cloud computing, it is undervalued. If you go by standard metrics, it's overvalued.

Disclaimer: I am a fucking idiot.",0.8526
"True.

I think if they continue to grow their revenue, arpu and customer count we should see increase in stock price. It’s insane how good they are in terms of efficiency and price management.",0.7783
"yeah I think big government contracts are a long way away.

do wonder if things do get sour that some larger business may test the waters of a more cost effective cloud provider and move some non critical workloads to DO",0.507
"Price targets are in the low $100 or so range, so probably that. I'm holding stocks, so from my napkin math it probably doesn't make sense to sell before 1 year of holding. Also, the recent selling of convertible notes priced at $170 seems bullish long term.  

Definitely some bearish points to be made, but I think the potential upside, coupled with the benefits of holding for a year+, make it worth it to hold. Not gonna buy more though.",0.7227

"What made DFV have such a high conviction on GME? - I'm new to investing and I recently went through archived DFV posts. Apart from the regularly updated positions, I couldn't find much about his thesis. I could see that majority of redditors were against the trade, advising to get out asap while he kept his composure during red days. The only thing he mentioned is that his thesis aligns with Burry's.

On August 16, 2019 Burry wrote a letter to GME management, here is the excerpt:

*As mentioned in our previous letter to the board, we have concerns regarding capital management at GameStop. Given recent GameStop common stock prices under $4 per share, we must re-state that GameStop complete the remaining $237,600,000 share repurchase at once and with urgency.*

*Given the market capitalization of GameStop at $290 million at the close on August 15th, completing the authorization would retire over 80% of GameStop’s outstanding shares. Depending on the timing and quality of execution, such a repurchase would increase earnings per share dramatically - far more than any other possible action on a* *per share* *basis.*

*The numbers are striking and demand action. We estimate that GameStop now has in excess of $480 million of cash, more than enough to complete the share repurchase authorization and still invest in the business and pay down debt.*

Seems to me the most important DFV and Burry's thesis was how much cash on hands GME had, while short position were betting on dying business and expecting this cash to evaporate quickly. How did DFV and Burry see the future of the company whose main business is dying - selling games on CD? Why did they have such a strong conviction apart the cash-on-hands?",0.9552

"Watch some of his videos on Youtube about it (Roaring Kitty), he goes in depth as to why he liked it so much. You have to keep in mind he's a classic value investor.

It was basically a perfect mix of factors. I think they had $9 of cash on their books when their stock was valued at $4. They made most of their money from reselling used games and the new consoles were confirmed to have disc drives. Management had already made clear they were in process of pivoting the business. They had no other retail competitors. The setiment against the stock was overly bearish and management hadn't guided sales with the new console release factored in. Other reasons too but those are the ones I remember off the top of my head.",0.8074

He saw the potential for a good investment, but I'm sure he didn't expect it to alter the thinking of the entire financial world.",0.3612
Gamestop had a niche that is hard to kill(people will always want physical games because of ownership or cool promos etc) and gamestop is the only place that makes money on physical games with no cost lol. A company is always worth at least its revenue that IS their market share so its what they command in their market. Gme was criminally(hehe) under valued for its revenue and outlook. What DFV had that one one else did was logic and math that proved he would make money on the trade. Probably didnt expect it to blow up like he did but sure as hell it was a very high probability of success trade because of how artificially low the share were priced,0.5499
"Aside from having more cash on the balance sheet than its valuation,

1. ""Physical games dying"" is overused and overexaggerated that's been propegated as far back as 2011 In the words of DFV ""people have been saying this shit since 2011"". [Physical games for consoles makes a bigger proportion of video game console sales over the past few years over digital.](https://variety.com/2019/gaming/features/physical-video-games-death-disc-digital-1203207513/#article-comments)
2.

There were people calling for the death of physical paper books when Kindle came around. 
3. GameStop was still generating a ton of cash but bogged down by a lot of unnecessary expense like capital lease expense. A little cost tightening and the market reacted positively as GameStop started closing it's unprofitable retail stores. EV/EBITDA was trading at less than 1x. On revenue alone, they were still generating annual revenues of around 6b to 7b.  That's the MKT cap on some of the garbage SPACs that don't even have products yet.

That's all I remember off the top of my head. But I know he has a lot more arguments on his YT channel.",-0.0901
He had good research available in the public domain. He has a video that says GME is not cigar bud but a roach. He did extensive analysis and asked people to debunk his theory based on that. One conviction point was people still want to buy CDs because consoles don’t have enough memory to store games. Possibly 3 games on a console but CDs are more manageable and easily comparable.

"Calls on GME , got it.",0.0
"Compilation from what I'm reading in this thread:

1. GME had virtually no retail competitor. There was no single video game only retailer that existed. Best Buy in the early 2000's was pretty close as it was another go to place to get games, but fundamentally Gamestop was where you went if you wanted video games. To this day there is no retailer that sells only specifically video games that has the brand recognition, name, and history that GME does. And I am talking about before the squeeze even happened. The stock squeeze gave GME so much free advertising.
2. The real estate that they owned was understated in their true liquidation value. As you'll see below, it is also true that their free cash flow was bigger than their market cap. This provides a nice cushion against downside risk.
3. Their price to book ratio and free cash flow provided a nice cushion of safety. I believe at one point the share price of GME was below how much dollars per share the company had if it were to instantly go out of business.
4. Management had talked within the last couple of years about how to reverse the course of the business, part of which was a conversion to ecommerce. I will be honest, with how hot ecommerce stocks got under covid (see JMIA, AMZN, SHOP), it's not surprising that this mere fact alone is probably what catapulted GME to insane gains.
5. Low market cap in general...hgh ceiling for reward potential, low loss potential (relatively speaking)
6. WSB clowned on DFV heavily for this position if you go through the old posts...The classic inverse WSB strategy strikes again.

Other things that very much aided in his success on GME that could not have been readily predicted:

1. Gamification of investing/trading due to robinhood
2. People being bored as hell during the pandemic due to lockdowns and embracing investing (read: ""gambling""). Also, a lot of the upper class people that normally spend their time vacationing and shit had nothing else to do with loads of savings they were storing up, and GME became a legal casino with which to bet that money
3. The fact that GME became a meme/cult stock on WSB and the narrative shifted to ""crush the hedgies"", and hold no matter what (the narrative basically now being that this is not about making money anymore, it's about making greedy short selling hedge funds lose money; social justice yadda yadda)
4. Citron posting about GME. Citron had been notoriously followed as a twitter account to inverse because they had been wrong about so many stocks in the past (nio, jmia), predicting their collapse and opening short positions on them. They said that GME would quickly fall back to $20, and they were dead wrong.

>It was basically a perfect mix of factors. I think they had $9 of cash on their books when their stock was valued at $4. They made most of their money from reselling used games and the new consoles were confirmed to have disc drives. Management had already made clear they were in process of pivoting the business. They had no other retail competitors. The setiment against the stock was overly bearish and management hadn't guided sales with the new console release factored in.

Before the hype I too would have dismissed this business: Brick and mortar, based on reselling physical media, on dying malls, at the mercy of content creators. Not a pretty picture.

During the hype, things changed. Their brand value skyrocketed. They brought executives with track record, and capitalized on the stock rise. They now have a shot, but it will be bumpy, and they can still screw up big time. The businesses that will lose from GameStop's impending rise are not sitting around waiting to be screwed over.

"there is a whole strategy behind those trades. warren buffet and DFV call them cigar butt investing, Benjamin Grahem called it Net-Net- investing. It's basiclly as you described it. Find companies that trade under liquidation-value and get a nice margin of safty and potential great returns. It's like the perfect strategy for small money, because big money can't move money so easely into a small cap company. Those trades are not that rare, but hard to find in bull markets. There are also a lot of papers (and i mean a lot) that proof, net-net-investing can beat the market by a high margin.

What you should first learn about this industry, if you want to succeed in it is that if something is easy and/or predictable, then it doesn't work/won't happen. You may get lucky and expect the expected and it happens just as planned, but most often, the big players are contrarian to the market itself, meaning that if you think A is likely and a million people think A is likely, then B is almost guaranteed to happen (unless enough contrarians think B will happen, then probably C)

Mind you, it does happen.

If you look at Burry's thesis on GME, it carries over to his investments in Tailored Brands (not sure if the bot will hit me for mentioning the ticker) and CLF. CLF paid off for him, but Tailored was frickin hammered into oblivion. (It's Qticker is something like 9 cents right now -- woof.)

Arguably, HTZZ is the in between outcome. (I don't believe Burry had bet on it.) They restructured in bankruptcy and came back. But, the shorts also hammered them pretty hard. That was a fun roller coaster ride last year when they bobbed up and down from like $1 to $5. If you churn swing trades, Hertz was some fun.

It doesn't hurt to screen for the companies the shorts are forming up against. They get out over their skis sometimes.",0.8756

"FIVERR is taking a DIVERR: Bearish DD for earnings tomorrow. - Greetings all,

If you somehow don’t know what Fiverr is and have miraculously avoided the millions of youtube videos titled “I paid three guys on Fiverr X to do my Y”, then here’s a quickie: Fiverr is an online marketplace where freelancers go to in order to sell their services. Whether it be modeling, graphic design or programming, the website makes it easier for the freelancer and buyer to connect, in contrast to posting an offer on their grandma's facebook page with only 7 friends.

Fiverr was AWESOME during the pandemic for the obvious reasons of everyone being on the computer more, out of work, and in need of money. But times have changed and this company is overvalued.

This company mainly makes its money of fees. It takes a cut from every transaction. Fiverr is heavily reliant on its Active Buyer base. From Q1 2020 to Q4 2020 Fiverr showed steady growth in active buyers. Active buyers are defined as buyers who purchased a gig or service on the platform within the last 12 months, not taking into account of cancellations.

https://preview.redd.it/b5qfdzvvwly71.jpg?width=657&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8491b9f60043065dc0d56c703a78036bf2be81a8

We see the biggest rise in active buyers in Q1 2021 with an additional 400,000 buyers, but in the quarter that followed immediately after we see the first decline in active buyer rate in the last 6 quarters: Only a 200,000 increase in active buyers. Q2 2021 was the first quarter they announced that people going out more for travel and finding jobs was going to be a major issue for this company going forward.

That is the main reason why the stock shit the bed 24% on the day. It was assumed that due the country moving out of lockdown there is a lower demand for freelance work. The estimates/expectations have lowered. Their exact words on their press release:

*“As COVID restrictions are lifted in many parts of the world, people are spending more time out of home and less time on screens. The reduced online activity translates into more modest new customer cohorts and less activity for older cohorts.""*

^(Source:) [^(https://investors.fiverr.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2021/Fiverr-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx)](https://investors.fiverr.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2021/Fiverr-Announces-Second-Quarter-2021-Results/default.aspx)

They indirectly admitted to their company being overvalued. Also, if I understand the last sentence correctly, its informing us that users that have spent the most time on the platform are leaving it/not using it as much while new users are coming in but not necessarily replacing quantity of those that have left?

People have been going out more. Take for instance hotel stocks like MGM. They’re up 21% this half year. Intercontinental is up 17% since September. Hilton hotels the same.

More people have been going to retail stores to buy goods/services. I don't know what data I can find online to prove this so I randomly selected Home Depot and searched their earnings. Their sales improved by 4.5% from their 2nd quarter. Really, I only used this as an example of people going out more to buy whatever. It just means that people are on their phones/computers less which means they're less likely to be on Fiverr.

Airline travel has also increased since January.

[Source: https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/air-travel-tracker-how-many-people-are-flying-usa-tsa-n1252745](https://preview.redd.it/xb2die6xuly71.jpg?width=996&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96b5f171d57a0b4b74520f4b9bd8d9fdbefb3796)

Unemployment is also down. More people are finding jobs. The lowest value is 4.6%.

[Source: https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/charts\/employment-situation\/civilian-unemployment-rate.htm](https://preview.redd.it/djwa9rsw0my71.jpg?width=884&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cad917691785e0c794af96ef5854f89c6b95c614)

We may have direct evidence of their dwindling buyer base. I used Similarweb, a website that allows me to track web and app traffic. Because I am a poorboi, I can only use the free version which only gives me 3 months of data.

Look at **website** traffic per region. Western countries either have risen by less than a percent of have flat out dropped. Lets be honest, like Chegg and other online services the majority of people offering service are from either the middle east or south Asia and the buyers are more Western. Us Westerners are lazy AF and you can't tell me nuthin! If that's true, then this shows me there are too many freelancers and not enough buyers. Also, the time spent on the website is also telling who's buying and who's selling.

&#x200B;

Acquisitions? Yes, two.

They bought Creativelive, an online learning platform where you can learn a bunch of different stuff from successful\* people. It will help freelancers learn shit.

A purchase that would’ve been good a year ago. Some of the biggest online education platforms have been sinking in the last year. Look at the website itself. Many classes that were offered at a price of $100+ are on massive sale. They’re struggling to sell.  I don’t understand this acquisition. If their major problem was less people being online because folks are spending more time outside and going back to school, why purchase a company that only sells online learning?

The stock fell 2.73% when this news was announced on Oct. 7th. The market didn't care for it.

They also acquired Stoke, a management platform company for $95m, announced Nov. 2nd. It was to improve their platform and help efficiently manage the relationship between the freelancer and buyer. The market reacted by shouting ""BORING!"" and dropping it by 2.4%.

Here's something interesting though. Linkedin came out two weeks ago with their own newly unleashed freelance service accessible worldwide.

Linkedin has **800 MILLION USERS.** Also, it offers arguably better service because you can talk directly to your clients on the website and elsewhere, say twitter or facebook. On Fiverr, if you are found to be communicating with your clients anywhere but on Fiverr, your account will be permanently deleted. Bruh. It looks like Fiverr got anxious and shot their load to quickly.

There other major competitor, Upwork, has also shit their diapers in their last earnings. Poor guidance for the very same reasons we discussed.

Before we wrap up, a quick word about their founders.  Micha Kaufman and Shai Wininger bouth founded this company. Shai is no longer on the board according to their website. He is also the founder of Lemonade Inc. rentals insurance, which has been doing pretty shit itself.

**FINAL THOUGHTS: T**his stock is overvalued and they indirectly said it themselves in their press release. They haven’t solved the problem of having a lower userbase in the quarters to come. Big boy competitors have entered a receding market. Freelancing will always exist, but not at this value. Unless FIVERR joins the metaverse, they fukt.

Positions: 19 NOV 19th 115p. Why so OTM? Because why the fuck not?

Also, this is not financial advice. Gamble what you’re okay to lose with.

&#x200B;

EDIT- Some folks might think that the earnings call will be after market close tomorrow. The results come in tomorrow pre-market. The time to buy the options was today. Anything after will be very risky.  (This is assuming the stock does tank).

&#x200B;

EDIT 2: 

I couldn't get a wink of sleep last night because I was terrified of being wrong about this. I've done bigger yolos in the past but never shared them with this sub. I desperately wanted you guys to make bank off this, but I fucked up.

I thought that the rate of decrease in active buyers, the country continuing to open up, and less people using their services would be a sell signal for investors. It decreased by 100,000 :

Q1: 3.8m

Q2: 4m

Q3: 4.1m

Simply put, they lowered guidance last quarter and and beat it this quarter. Then they raised their guidance. I must've had a fatal oversight, but I'm too fucked right now to investigate. Sorry everyone.

"As a freelancer, I can tell you that Fiverr and Upwork are both insanely overvalued. They facilitate a race to the bottom for aspiring freelancers, lower market value of services, and charge exorbitant fees for just being a broker/middleman.

Even when you reply to someone through the customer resolution section a new person responds. I ended up having to do a chargeback on my credit card and then both fiverr and the person I paid both sent threatening responses to undo the chargeback or else they would ban me from fiverr.

Stocks pay out dividends all the time but I've never seen this this huge, and specifically for January 2022 rather than November/December.

Also note there's a little BP in there which doesn't pay a dividend but does the same thing XOM does.

A sick gain tbh.,0.0258
"OP bought 60 contracts for 100$ each, so 6000 dollars total. This contract expires in jan 22 of 2022. 

Now what exactly is the contract about? 

The contract is basically saying that OP will buy 100 shares of this stock at 105$ per share price NO MATTER WHAT PRICE IT IS BEFORE JAN 22.  This means OP is agreeing to buy 100*60= 6,000 shares of $NEWR before Jan 22 at 105$ per share. But since NEWR is well above that at 124$ per share, OP has a gain of the difference. 

So since he agreeed to buy it at 105 but stock is at 124, OP has gained 19$ per share, and he has 6,000 shares, so this is 114,000 profit. 

You may see that his profit is actually bigger than this- that’s because his contract hasn’t expire yet (it’s not Jan 22) so that 114k gets a little boost since the stock could go up more. This is more like “potential profit” that could happen added to his gains as premium. If the stock stays same until Jan 22, his gain will be exactly 114k.",0.9938

"I am financially ruined (agricultural futures)

I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested 17,500 florentines (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental tulip futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a play about Johan Van Odenbarnevelt and his monopoly on spices, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another crop. I did some research and found out many farmhands expected this year's tulip yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Flevoland and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around walpurgisnacht and prices skyrocketed, but the Tulip bubble burst on February 12th. Unfortunately, the Spanish flu caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their mausoleums for allerheiligen, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new letter in my aviary caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive tulip shipment from the Ottoman empire, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the tulips in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 farthings per pound. I am ruined.",-0.9375

"**[Tulip mania](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania)** 
 
 >Tulip mania (Dutch: tulpenmanie) was a period during the Dutch Golden Age when contract prices for some bulbs of the recently introduced and fashionable tulip reached extraordinarily high levels, with the major acceleration starting in 1634 and then dramatically collapsing in February 1637. It is generally considered to have been the first recorded speculative bubble or asset bubble in history. In many ways, the tulip mania was more of a thitherto unknown socio-economic phenomenon than a significant economic crisis.

"Has anybody else noticed this? 63.22% Dark Pool Short Interest, 0.88 days to cover. $AMD - This is huge. Today with all the great news with the metaverse plus the chip shortage, it should have gone up. But it seems as if someone's intentionally trying to keep $AMD down.  We all know with how fast tech is evolving, these chips are just going to get higher and higher demand, while bottlenecking the companies.

5.76% - source: NASDAQ (short interest)

63.22% Dark Pool Short Interest

This is why the price keeps coming down even though everyone knows $AMD is bound to skyrocket with the news.

"NVAX (NOVAVAX) shorted by big hedge funds like J.P. Morgan. WHY?? - Because this low cost, tried and true protein subunit vaccine has the potential to vaccinate the world, rich and poor, and the mRNA vaccine hesitant or those with medical such as blood clotting concerns. Anyone else invested contrary to Goliath again for some honest gains in a good company? Any thoughts?

Update: [NOVAVAX CEO INTERVIEW 11.10.21](https://finance.yahoo.com/video/novavax-ceo-aim-complete-fda-155632671.html) 

Reference for NOVAVAX sumary: [YALE MEDICINE](https://www.yalemedicine.org/news/covid-19-vaccine-comparison

Novavax has a vaccine shown to be highly effective against the COVID-19 coronavirus and against variants at decent percentages compared to the mRNAs. They are just began completing submissions for emergency use authorizations in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and plan to submit for the United States by the end of the year 2021 landing at end of December 2021. They have received around 1.6 Billion dollars from the Trump administration’s operation warp speed. Their headquartered in Maryland. They have partnered with the Serum Institute of India, the largest vaccine supplier to scale production of vaccines. 

There are lawsuits against claims from Politico anonymous “sources” article in October, I recall, that are refuted to be exaggerated and inaccurate information about their quality and production ability. They already have millions of vaccines stockpiled and have advanced purchase orders. They will have tiered pricing to accommodate low income nations and wealthier nations. 

NOVAVAX has been granted emergency use authorization in Indonesia and is pending the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and the World Health Organization after their excellent and very positive human trials in the UK. 

Why is this company expected to loose? Shouldn’t their profits only vastly increase as they get approvals nation by nation. 

They are also a viable booster vaccine to people who have used other vaccines against COVID-19. Lastly, NVAX has also created a combo seasonal influenza and COVID-19 jab that has the same effective proprietary Matrix adjuvant that stimulates immune response. 

For those who are unaware, the protein subunit vaccine is different from an mRNA vaccine. 

The mRNA instructs muscle cell ribosomal conscription to manufacture COVID-19 protein spikes and creates a cytotoxic cell surface expression where your bodies T cells recognize the cell as hostile and mutant and destroys those muscle cells to gain and be taught immunity. 

The protein subunit vaccine doesn’t hijack human cells for covid protein spikes but instead uses insect cells to create the spikes. These spikes are then harvest and attached to nanoparticle shells to mimic the covid virus shape and combines it with their immune stimulating adjuvant that alerts the T cells to destroy the FOREIGN material that was injected into the body, creating immunity.

Disclaimer: not financial advice, not a doctor, may possibly be inaccurate information. Material presented as information purposes only with urging to do your own research and critically examine my statements. I’m not trying to persuade, not claiming to be a source of authority. I’m just a college educated human being trying to communicate with other humans about a company, their product, news around the company and trying to understand why hedge funds are betting on failure for the company in terms of declined stock value.",0.9739

"Are they also shorting Medicago? That company is also coming out with a new covid vaccine that's plant based.
The MRNA causes autoimmunity and shuts off your non specific immune cells so that the MRNA has time to get into the cell and create spike proteins.
But those non specific immune cells are what's supposed to find cancer cells or sometimes can defends the body right away and prevent the need for immediate antibodies.
That's why shingles are a side effect of the MRNA. I know someone who got shingles after taking the MRNA. For those who don't know, shingles are a reactivated chicken pox virus, anybody who's had chicken pox can get shingles.

Mexico's president is complaining that the USA hasn't approved the Chinese Sinovac vaccine or the Russian Sputnik vaccine and starting Nov 8 millions of Mexicans, some who are truck drivers ect. Won't be able to cross the border starting Nov 8th because those vaccines haven't been approved.

"META - Another autist bullish case scenario - Good morning ladies and gentlemen; degenerates and OPs, Mods and whoever else reads my autistic DD.

I present to you a very diverse ticker (META). This is an ETF consisting of many high growth stocks such as FB, AMD and the daddy of them all - NVDA along with many others. Please see below for charting. 

I believe this stock will be trading around $18 by the end of the week. Momentum has increased around METAverse related stocks such as AMD and NVDA as well as FB. While the idea of creating a meta verse is not new; it will continue to gain momentum in the coming months and years.

Metaverse/Omniverses will not be created overnight; however, we can continue to see increase activity surrounding these ideas.

Big dates: 

Six weeks since ETF began trading (don't have date sorry) - **Crosses $50 Million in assets**

9/14/2021 - META ETF Crossed **$100 Million in assets.**

11/8/2021 - META ETF Crossed **$250 Million in assets.**

11/9/2021 - Currently sitting at **$281 Million.**

**Please see below for ETF Holding breakdown.**

https://preview.redd.it/pas5a14mqly71.png?width=767&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a7b66c44bf146e3c1e0b77e9f3a82b4fdcba3b7

This ETF has potential to hit $300 million by the end of the year if it holds its momentum. Furthermore if the above stocks continue to hold their current levels or if they gain more momentum we can see $320 Million. This is just a general DD. I will provide more in-depth DD soon!

"EU thinking about banning payment for order flow -  

The European Commission is planning to ban payment for order flow,  paralleling potential U.S. moves to stem a practice that hit the  headlines during the meme-stock mania.

A forthcoming review of the Markets in Financial  Instruments Directive will include a ban amid other measures to increase  transparency, such as a [consolidated tape](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-12-05/eu-overhaul-has-failed-to-lower-data-costs-top-regulator-says) of information about transactions, people familiar with the matter said.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is separately [weighing](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-05/gensler-signals-new-rules-that-could-threaten-robinhood-citadel)  a ban on payment for order flow, in which trading firms pay retail  brokerages to execute their trades. Regulators are concerned that  video-game like prompts have encouraged excessive trading on app-based  brokerages that fueled a explosive surge in value for GameStop Corp. and  other stocks this year.
